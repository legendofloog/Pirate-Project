[ML]
[Beat]Are you listening?[AN]
[R]
Hm?[AN]
[ML]
Why call me to your quarters for a report[N]
if you're just going to space out?[AN]
[R]
Sorry, Rahel. I've been thinking[N]
about other matters, recently.[AN]
A lot on the mind when you get older.[AN]
[ML]
Sorry, I don't care. Anyway,[N]
the repairs are about done.[AN]
The ship is fully functional.[N]
Just needs some bells and whistles.[AN]
[R]
Good work. I took a look around,[N]
and it looks better than it did before.[AN]
You really are worth your weight in gold.[AN]
[ML]
I don't really weigh much[Beat] Besides,[N]
that level of work is easy to beat.[AN]
I'm not sure who the shipwright was,[N]
but they did a terrible job with it.[AN]
I would've been done in half the time[N]
without so many odd design choices.[AN]
[R]
It was a budget option, I'll admit.[AN]
But since you did such a good job,[N]
I think you deserve a bonus for it.[AN]
You can go buy some confections,[N]
or whatever it is kids want.[AN]
Maybe Razvan can tell you about turr[ó]n.[A]
[ML]
I'll take the gold, but listen up.[AN]
Stop treating me like a child,[N]
or I'll put a hole in your ship's hull.[AN][X]

[ML][LoadRahel]
[R][LoadLuaHatless]
[FFR][LoadOrlando]
[FFR][MoFR]
[FR]
Bit of a sore point, eh lass?[N]
Try not to take it so personal.[AN]
Coming from old codgers like us,[N]
Lua is almost giving you a compliment![AN]
[R]
[OQ]Us[CQ]? Compared to me,[N]
you're a fossil.[AN]
[ML]
I agree with the captain.[AN]
Besides, it's pretty clear you both[N]
don't take me seriously at all.[AN]
[FR]
It's more like[Beat] I remember my youth,[N]
and the worries that came with it.[AN]
But looking back at them now,[N]
so many of them were foolish.[AN]
[ML]
Is that why you act the fool now?[N]
Making up for lost time, gramps?[AN]
[FR]
Heh, maybe so. In any case,[N]
you have plenty of time to grow up.[AN]
No need to rush through it, Rahel.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][A][X]

[FR][LoadOrlando]
[FFL]
Neiiiiiiigh![A]
[ML]
Huh? What's wrong, girl?[N]
Why are you shaking?[AN]
[R]
Is that[Beat] a horse?[AN]
[ML]
Yes, her name's Daisy.[AN]
I send her out to graze[N]
while I work, usually[Beat][AN]
But she never does this.[N]
She's trembling, but why?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]I would wager the answer[N]
is nothing good, Lua.[AN]
Let me go rouse the others[N]
resting in crew quarters.[A][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene4
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR]
Pilar! What's going on out there?[AN]
[ML]
Imperials found us, that's what.[AN]
The traps slowed them down,[N]
but that's all. They're coming![AN]
[MR]
Who would have tipped them off?[AN]
[Beat]No, that's not important right now.[N]
Let's greet our guests, shall we?[A][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene5
[ML][LoadElodia]
[R][LoadLua]
[ML]
So this is the hovel you call a base[Beat][N]
Allow me to introduce myself, pirates.[AN]
I am Elodia, an officer of TORCH.[N]
I trust you know what that means?[AN]
[R][3LB]
Well, there's only one reason[N]
that the Pirate Hunter[N]
would pay me a visit.[AN]
[ML]
Good, no pretenses. To be specific,[N]
you and your crew are suspected[N]
of several counts of grand larceny.[AN]
Especially against the merchantry[Beat][N]
In order to verify the truth,[N]
I have a warrant for your arrest.[AN]
[R][2LB]
And what if I choose to not comply?[A]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Under Article I, Section III[N]
of Incendivis legal code,[N]
that allows me to apply force.[AN]
Lethal force, if need be.[AN][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene6
[ML][LoadElodia]
[R][LoadLua]
[FFR][LoadRazvan][2LB]
[FFR][MoFR]
Miss Elodia[Beat]?[N]
Do you remember me, Razvan?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Mm[Beat] That I do. You were the[N]
boy always clinging onto Fidel.[N]
How did you end up here, Razvan?[AN]
[MR]
Ah, well[Beat] On my first mission,[N]
the Blackhearts ravaged my squad[N]
and left me stranded on an island.[AN]
If the captain and her crew hadn't[N]
saved me, I would have died that day[Beat][N]
They're all good people, for pirates.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Good people do not lie.[N]
Good people do not steal.[N]
And good people do not kill.[AN]
I thought Fidel would have[N]
taught you that much,[N]
if your mother never did.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]He did, and she did. But they also[N]
taught me to always repay my debts.[N]
So I joined them. Am I a bad person, too?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]That depends. Piracy is a crime[N]
that demands immediate punishment.[AN]
[Beat]But under Article III, Section V,[N]
if one joins a pirate crew under duress,[N]
there are[Beat] exceptions that can be made.[AN]
[FR][ToggleMouthMove]
(Does she mean that I'm safe,[N]
so long as I betray you all?)[AN]
[R]
(Of course. Well? This is your chance[N]
to leave the pirate's life, for good.[N]
Isn't that what you wanted?)[AN]
[FR][1LB]
(I...[.4])[AN]
[R][ToggleMouthMove][3LB]
Shouldn't have spelled it out so clear,[N]
Incendivis dog. Now that I know,[N]
I won't give up my hostage here.[AN]
[ML]
Of all the dastardly maneuvers[Beat][N]
I should have expected a pirate to-[AN]
[FR]
Drop the act, Captain Lua![N]
I'm not going anywhere, not yet.[N]
Miss Elodia, let me say it plain.[AN]
Everything that I've done as a member of[N]
Captain Lua's crew was of my own will![AN]
This path is one that I chose for myself![N]
So even if treading it means that I must[N]
face you[Beat] I won't waver a single step![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Is that how it is, then?[N]
Fine. If you're an accessory to theft,[N]
then I have to arrest you as well.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Ha, guess you're stuck with us then.[N]
Then let's bring the theatrics to an end.[N]
Sorry, Pirate Hunter, but no surrender.[AN]
As it happens, we were already leaving;[N]
you've just sped up our flight, is all![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I hoped that this could be resolved[N]
without bloodshed, but I expected that[N]
this would be your choice, Captain Lua.[AN]
[Beat]But you will not flee so easily.[N]
Ignacio, it's time! Surround them![AN]
[R]
Damn, she's calling in back-up![N]
Razvan, follow me! We're[N]
getting back to the ship![AN][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene7
[MR][LoadIgnacio]
This damn well better be worth it[Beat][N]
Alright, Igniswords! Listen up![AN]
Our job is to hold position and keep[N]
this sorry bunch from flying off.[AN]
After the battle, anything on that[N]
ship and in this base is ours![AN][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene8
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[R][LoadOrlando]
[ML][LoadLua]
[R]
I'm back, Lua![N]
[Beat]Well, this looks hairy.[AN]
[FR][3LB]
That's one way to say it. We're[N]
surrounded, boss. No flyin' away.[N]
How the hell do we get out of this?[AN]
[ML]
Instead of a problem, Desiderio,[N]
think of it as an opportunity.[AN]
Our crew's gotten fairly large.[N]
And our boat's fairly small[Beat][AN]
So instead of sinking that blowhard's[N]
ship, let's rout the [OQ]Igniswords[CQ][N]
and take it for ourselves, hm?[AN]
[FR]
You want to seize their boat?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Pff[Beat] Bahahaha! You're crazy, boss.[N]
Count me in! I've always wanted to cut[N]
that moron and his crew down a peg.[AN]
What a dumb name[Beat][ToggleSmile] I'd better not see[N]
you come up with one half as stupid.[A]
[ML]
The name isn't really at the top of[N]
my priority list right now, Desiderio.[N]
But I'll give more effort than he did.[AN]
Orlando, what's your plan here?[N]
You're not really one of us,[N]
so maybe you should slink away.[AN]
[R]
You wound me, Lua. I'd never leave[N]
a friend in need! Though, if I did[Beat][N]
I suspect that I wouldn't get far.[AN]
And if I did, they would have a wanted[N]
poster ready for me within a week[Beat][N]
So why not stay and play pirate, I say?[AN]
Worse comes to worst, I can always pay[N]
off someone to clear my bounty and[N]
let me return to civilized society.[A]
[ML]
Corrupt as always, aren't you[Beat]?[N]
Well, if you want to stick around,[N]
then I won't turn you away, Orlando.[AN]
In fact, here's your first order;[N]
take half of our crew and defeat[N]
Ignacio's band over there, got it?[AN]
I'll take to the left and handle[N]
the main force of TORCH,[N]
protecting our main ship.[AN]
[R]
Already working me hard, [OQ]captain?[CQ][N]
I must admit, it may take time for me[N]
to get used to taking orders from you[Beat][AN]
But command me as you see fit, Lua![N]
So long as I have leeway to purloin[N]
whatever valuables I wish, that is[Beat][A][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene9
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRahel][3LB]
W-What about me? I'm not cut out[N]
for this[Beat] I don't like impies,[N]
but this isn't my job, captain![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Maybe so, but do you think TORCH[N]
will just let you go? You don't have[N]
Orlando's connections, Rahel.[AN]
They'll know you worked with us,[N]
and that'll raise questions.[N]
Problems for Ida, most likely.[AN]
[MR]
Ugh[Beat] I knew we shouldn't have taken[N]
this job, no matter the pay[Beat] Fine.[N]
I'm not going to cause Ida any trouble.[AN]
She's done enough for me as it is.[N]
Guess I've got no choice; I'll fight[N]
with you and play pirate til we're safe.[AN]
But you'd better not get me killed,[N]
or Ida'll make you regret it, understand?[AN]
[ML]
Threatening your new captain already?[N]
Can't tell if you're brave or dumb[Beat][N]
But welcome aboard for now, Rahel.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MR][ClearFace]
[ML]
Alright, time to listen up, everyone![N]
Our plan's simple; protect our ship,[N]
take Ignacio's, then ready for takeoff![AN]
We won't be able to hang around port,[N]
so there's only one way to go now:[N]
deep into the unexplored outskirts.[AN]
It'll be a proper adventure,[N]
filled with gold and glory[Beat][AN]
So fight like hell and survive today,[N]
that we can take that path tomorrow![N]
Follow my lead, and we'll win this![A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene1
[FL][LoadDesiderio]
[L][LoadLua][3LB]
All that's left is getting out of here[N]
before those dogs can catch up to us.[N]
Desiderio, help me with these planks![AN]
[FL][2LB]
You got it, boss![AN][X]


## Ch2EndingScene2
[R][LoadOrlando]
[FR][LoadPilar]
[R]
I suppose that's our sign to follow suit.[N]
May I have your assistance, my lady?[AN]
[FR]
Save the charm for someone who cares.[N]
You'd better do your part, merchant.[AN]
[R]
You and Lua are far too alike[Beat][N]
Worry not, I'm no burden yet![A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene3
[ML][LoadElodia]
[ML]
[Beat]Hell. Headquarters won't let me hear[N]
the end of this failure, will they?[AN][X]


## Ch2EndingScene4
[ML][LoadElodia]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Miss Elodia! I[Beat] I'm truly sorry[N]
that we had to meet again this way.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Razvan. You certainly have grown,[N]
in some ways. But you forget yourself.[AN]
In repaying one debt to these pirates,[N]
you've reneged on your debt to the[N]
empire. Where would you be, without it?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Who knows? Were I to guess,[N]
I would say that I never would[N]
have escaped my hometown.[AN]
That I would never have become[N]
anything of worth, in that place.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]And now, everyone back home[N]
will know what has become of you,[N]
Razvan, when they see your bounty.[AN]
Even your mother will see your price[Beat][N]
Will that be worth your momentary[N]
impetuousness today, you foolish child?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]It isn't fleeting passion that[N]
guides me, Miss Elodia. It's belief.[AN]
Belief that Captain Lua is worthy of[N]
my respect and service, until my debt[N]
is fully repaid. So, to your question[Beat][AN]
I don't care if the world turns against[N]
me. Doing what's right is always worth it![N]
[Beat]Goodbye, Miss Elodia. Live well![A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene5
[ML][LoadElodia]
[ML][MoMR]
[MR]
[3LB]
[Beat]Hmph. My greatest failure yet,[N]
and it's handed to me by a naive fool.[AN]
But I won't let it end like this,[N]
not with half my squad left.[AN]
I'll hunt them down to the last man,[N]
to the end of the world if I must[Beat][AN]
[FFL][LoadAlonso]
And how d'you plan on that?[A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene6
[MR][LoadElodia]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
[MR][3LB]
Stop where you stand,[N]
or you'll die there.[N]
Who are you, vagrant?[AN]
[ML]
Ooh, fiery. You sure that's how you[N]
wanna talk to an informant, woman?[AN]
[MR]
So you provided our anonymous tip[Beat][N]
Still, you didn't answer my question.[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Guess I ain't famous enough yet, eh?[N]
The name's Alonso, captain of the[N]
Blackhearts. Know who I am now?[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Of course I do. Your crew[N]
represents all that I loathe.[AN]
And now, I'm even more puzzled.[N]
Why tell me this, when you know[N]
exactly what TORCH would do to you?[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Hahahaha! Try to take me in, y'mean?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Go ahead, then. Fair warnin', though;[N]
I'm here knowin' you might do that,[N]
so it ain't gonna be that easy.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]I don't have time for these games.[N]
Well, Alonso? What do you want?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
To see if you'd win, of course.[N]
And to offer some backup, if not.[N]
Got here a bit too late, though.[AN]
I was keepin' tabs on the ship they[N]
took from us, among other things.[N]
The one they killed my men to take.[AN]
Now, I'm not one to act high and mighty.[N]
I know we're scum. But my rotten crew[N]
is MY bilge to do what I want with.[AN]
Anyone who'd do my men harm, or worse,[N]
kill 'em[Beat] They'll wish they fell[N]
to the Lands Below when I'm done.[AN]
So, since I want 'em dead, and you're[N]
the law, we've got some common ground.[N]
Why not team up, [OQ]Pirate Hunter[CQ]?[AN]
[MR]
My title should give you reason enough.[AN]
But[Beat] if you were to sign a contract[N]
and offer your service to Incendivis,[N]
then I could at least consider it.[AN]
[ML]
Like that fool Ignacio? Hard bargain[Beat][N]
No one's ever accused the Blackhearts[N]
of good deeds, and I like it that way.[AN]
But[Beat] if it means I can pay blood[N]
for blood, then it's worth it.[AN]
[MR]
If they surrender, I won't allow it,[N]
but if they resist[Beat] Then you and your[N]
Blackhearts can do what you do best.[AN]
But you will do so following my orders,[N]
not your whims. Is that clear, Alonso?[AN]
[ML]
Crystal. You can call the shots,[N]
so long as I get their heads.[AN]
Let's get that contract over with[N]
already[Beat] Hell, I might need a drink[N]
after. The sacrifices I make[Beat][A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene7
[MR][LoadRebelLeader][3LB]
Excellent. It seems those pirates[N]
escaped the empire's grip, after all.[AN]
The empire's hunting dogs appear as[N]
inept as their homeland is corrupt[Beat][AN]
And although I cheer their opponents,[N]
destruction without creation means nil.[AN]
A new world order must replace it.[N]
Anyone who does not understand that[N]
will never deserve the Fire Emblem[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch2Title
Ch 2: Flight of the Hunted[X]

## Ch2GoalWindow
Hijack/Defend[X]

## Ch2StatusObjective
  Protect Lua's boat[N]
while taking Ignacio's.[X]

## Chapter2Explanation
Orlando's group is in charge of hijacking[N]
Ignacio's boat as quickly as possible,[N]
via routing Ignacio and his crew.[AN]
After this is done, it will take an[N]
additional [Red]3 Turns[Red] to ready for takeoff,[N]
so try to do this as soon as possible.[AN]
During this time, Lua's group must prevent[N]
enemies from reaching their own boat.[N]
If an enemy stands on it, [Red]Game Over.[Red][AN]
Units with blue diamonds will prioritize[N]
standing on it above all else, so make[N]
sure to not let them pass your forces.[AN]
The bosses will not move immediately,[N]
but they and their groups will charge[N]
after enough time has passed.[A][X]

## Ch2_3MinutesLeft
[MR][LoadLua]
3 minutes left[Beat][N]
Keep up the fight![A][X]

## Ch2_2MinutesLeft
[MR][LoadLua]
2 minutes left[Beat][N]
Will we hold?[A][X]

## Ch2_1MinutesLeft
[MR][LoadLua]
1 minute left[Beat][N]
Just a bit more, everyone![A][X]

## Ch2_0MinutesLeft
[MR][LoadLua]
That's[Beat] That's it![AN]
I can hear the sound of Ignacio's[N]
airship humming. Orlando did it![AN]
Alright, everyone. We're done here![AN]
Fall back to the ship so we can[N]
get the hell out of here, now![A][X]

## Ch2AllIgniswordsDefeated
[MR][LoadOrlando]
Heh, that was as simple as could be![N]
Now, I just have to raise this ship, eh?[AN]
A challenge, certainly, but not one that[N]
I cannot handle! Watch and learn, Lua![A][X]

## Ch2ElodiasCharge
[ML][LoadElodia][3LB]
[Beat]I've seen enough of this.[N]
My subordinates can't handle this[N]
on their own. Time to change tactics![AN]
All TORCH, drop your positions[N]
and [ToggleRed]charge![ToggleRed] Let's finish the hunt![AN][X]

## ElodiaBossQuoteCh2 
[ML][LoadElodia]
I wanted to make this easy,[N]
but yet, you all still resist.[AN]
Your crimes end here and now![AN][X]

## IgnacioBossQuote
[ML][LoadIgnacio]
Y-You got through the[N]
rest of my crew?![AN]
Well, so long as I live,[N]
I'll get the promised gold.[AN]
I'll rebuild the crew,[AN]
with as many damn meatbags[N]
as I need to keep living![AN]
That's the power of siding[N]
with Incendivis, skydogs![AN]
At the end of the day,[N]
the empire always wins![AN]
So just give up and roll[N]
over. You're already dead![A][X]

## HugoWarning
[ML][LoadHugo][3LB]
Heh, I've finally got a chance to show[N]
Commander Elodia that my promotion[N]
wasn't a fluke[Beat] Get ready, fellas![AN]
From what I hear, these pirates know[N]
how to throw down. Show 'em why you've[N]
got that crest! Show 'em TORCH's power![A][X]

## HugoBossQuote
[ML][LoadHugo]
So, it's finally time to brawl[Beat][N]
Y'know, something bothered me.[AN]
The case file for you guys[N]
made no sense to me at all.[AN]
Sometimes you kill imperials,[N]
sometimes you save 'em[Beat][AN]
[Beat]Well, makes no difference.[AN]
TORCH is here to take you in,[N]
dead or alive. You chose dead.[AN]
So I don't need to think;[N]
I just need to beat you down![A][X]

## JulianaWarning
[ML][LoadJuliana][3LB]
Aaah[Beat] Do we really have to fight?[N]
I knew the pay raise from this[N]
promotion wasn't worth a damn.[AN]
Let's just sit back and leave most[N]
of this fight to Hugo. Though, if[N]
the pirates come[Beat] They'll regret it.[AN][X]

## JulianaBossQuote 
[ML][LoadJuliana]
Ugh. I really didn't want[N]
to do anything, you know?[AN]
But you got way too close[Beat][AN]
And I've heard enough about[N]
you guys to not just sit here.[AN]
Otherwise, you'd just kill[N]
me, like everyone else[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
And that would be way too[N]
long of a nap for my tastes![AN][X]

[ML][3LB]
Hey, [OQ]captain![CQ] Looks like scale[N]
jockeys are flying out of that cave.[AN]
They'll be trouble if they get too[N]
close to the ship. All my hard work[Beat][N]
Let me make sure they don't ruin it![AN]
[MR]
Uh, if you're offering, then sure.[N]
But what's your plan, exactly?[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Huh? Well, I can shoot them just fine.[N]
Better, though, my arrows have netting[N]
properties, which'll nail 'em down![AN]
[MR]
That does sounds useful[Beat] Alright,[N]
Rahel. Let's see what you're worth![A][X]
