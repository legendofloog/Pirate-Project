## ThePlan
[FL][LoadLua]
[L][LoadDesiderio]
[R][LoadPilar]
[FR][LoadRazvan]
[FL][3LB]
Listen up, everyone. The plan is simple.[N]
We'll seize Jozef's supply ship to get[N]
into the Blessed Isle and get to work.[AN]
Allegedly, he's producing a gun powerful[N]
enough to change war as we know it[Beat][N]
Well, his skilled gunsmiths are, really.[AN]
To ruin his plans, we'll keep it simple;[N]
break into the compound and kill them.[N]
No gunsmiths, no gun, no gold for Jozef.[AN]
[R]
Mm[Beat] Crude, but I have no objections.[N]
The man peddles to rebel and imperial,[N]
leveraging each to garner more gold.[AN]
He, more than anyone, symbolizes[N]
the rot taking root in Incendivis.[AN]
[FR]
I[Beat] He sounds horrible, Miss Pilar.[N]
How are the Imperial Marines[N]
letting him get away with this?[AN]
[FL]
Because enough of them are in his pocket.[N]
When you have gold and weapons,[N]
you can afford friends in high places.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]And this ain't the main reason you[N]
wanna take him down a peg, boss?[N]
I thought this was some kinda grudge.[AN]
[FL]
It is. It just so happens that I hold[N]
a grudge against one of the worst[N]
men in the skies. A nice coincidence, hm?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]He does seem like a bad man, yes.[N]
But the factory[Beat] The people working[N]
there may not all share in his greed.[AN]
Some of them may just be working here[N]
to put food on the table, right?[N]
Is this[Beat] really the right decision?[A]
[L]
You start thinkin' like that, Razvan,[N]
and the thoughts'll never end.[AN]
The Blackhearts we threw down to the[N]
Lands Below mighta had families, too.[N]
Maybe children who'll never see 'em again.[AN]
[FR]
Y-Yes, but they kill and pillage![N]
It's hardly the same as slaughtering[N]
craftsmen that we dislike, Desiderio.[AN]
[R]
Would you not say that Jozef's gunsmiths[N]
kill by creating deadly weapons of war?[AN]
Do they not pillage by profiting at the[N]
expense of these lives and corrupting[N]
the marines with promises of doubloons?[AN]
[FR][1LB]
I[Beat][A]
[FL][3LB]
That's how it is, Razvan. If that's[N]
not convincing to you, then feel[N]
free to sit out this mission.[AN]
You're not really a pirate, anyway.[N]
No one expects you to do this-[A]
[FR]
No, I am a pirate! So long as I sortie[N]
under this flag, that is the life I lead.[N]
That means I must uphold my oath, captain.[AN]
I swore to repay you, and everyone,[N]
for saving my life, and I meant it.[N]
You can count on me, no matter what![AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Well, I'm glad to hear it.[N]
Then we're done talking, here.[N]
Time to put the plan into practice![AN][X]

## Tangyuan1
[ML][LoadTangyuan][MR][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MR]
What are you doing on our[N]
property? No loitering.[A]
[3LB][ML]
It's pouring out there! My poor[N]
wyvern and I are as cold as it is.[N]
We'll be gone once the rain clears.[AN]
[1LB][MR]
Not my problem. Scram.[A]
[2LB][ML]
You really can't give a woman and[N]
a wyvern half an hour of shelter?[AN]
I see how it is. You're just doing[N]
this because you think you can.[AN]
You don't own this place; you're just[N]
a nobody wanting to push people around.[AN]
[MR]
So what if I am? The boss wouldn't want[N]
vagrants like you stinking up the Isle.[AN]
[ML]
Please, I can smell you from here.[N]
I am not leaving until the rain goes.[A][X]

## ThePlan2
[ML][LoadMrMist][R][LoadLua][FR][LoadDesiderio]
[3LB][R]
The supplies ordered are all here. We'd like[N]
to request your hospitality, given we'd rather[N]
not make the return trip in this weather.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
You didn't open with[N]
the established codeword.[A]
[1LB][R]
You see, we were-[A]
[ML][Event]
Imposters! Invaders![A]
[ML][ClearFace]
[2LB][FR]
That was the shortest con job[N]
I've seen in my life, boss.[AN]
[R]
It got us onto the Isle without being[N]
shot out of the sky. That's enough.[AN]
Let's clear them out before they[N]
can alert the rest of the Isle![A][X]



## Tangyuan2
[ML][LoadTangyuan][MR][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MR]
Aha! I knew you were up to no good.[N]
Must be a scout for these invaders.[AN]
[ML]
Don't be ridiculous! Was it such a hard ask[N]
to stay under this roof for half an hour?[A]
[MR]
I am so smart. Boss is going to[N]
give me a promotion after this.[AN]
[ML]
You know what? Fine. I am with the invaders.[N]
I'll enjoy shoving my axe down your gullet![A]
[MR][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Did you just say you're with us?[AN]
I'm the captain of this crew,[N]
so I'll be making that decision.[AN]
[ML]
Looking at the size of your crew,[N]
there's not much decision to be made.[AN]
[MR]
Well, we definitely could use more[N]
members, but I don't even know who-[AN]
[ML]
Tangyuan. Look, we both want to take[N]
these guys out, and I need a job.[AN]
Take me on, and you won't regret it.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Fine, you're in. But I'll be[N]
keeping an eye on you, Tangyuan.[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Suit yourself. You'll get to see why[N]
I'm a woman worth keeping around![A][X]

## Hakman1
[FL][LoadHakman][R][LoadTheDuke]
[R]
How can you lazy louts be so slow?[N]
This building was unfinished yesterday![AN]
[FL]
Our men are doing all we can in this rain.[N]
You think we can finish in an afternoon?[AN]
[R]
We don't get paid until you finish.[N]
I demand you put in some extra hours.[AN]
Getting between a mercenary and his[N]
gold is some dangerous business.[A]
[FL]
Look. We are putting in extra hours,[N]
but there really isn't much else-[AN]
[R]
We can make life a tad less enjoyable[N]
for you fools, if you keep this up.[AN]
[L][LoadBigBrick]
[1LB][L]
Nice bow.[AN]
[R]
Hey! Give that-[AN]
[2LB][L]
[PlaySound][0x8F][0x8A][0x80][0x80]Wouldn't want your spine[N]
breaking the same way.[AN]
[1LB][R]
[Beat][A][X]


## Hakman2
[ML][LoadHakman][MR][LoadBigBrick]
[ML]
Wouldn't have guessed[N]
he had such speed in him.[A]
[3LB][MR]
I've seen his type plenty. Bought a new[N]
bow and thinks he's on top of the world,[N]
but he can't buy skill or courage.[AN]
Knowing what kind of person they are[N]
and how much you can push them's key[N]
to dealing with others as a leader.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
Wise words, Big Brick. Thanks[N]
for covering for me, by the way.[AN]
I'm not cut out for this leading[N]
business; I fold too easily.[AN]
[MR]
Nonsense. That can always be taught,[N]
but dedication to your boys?[AN]
That doesn't come easy, Hakman.[AN]
With our last leader leaving us out to[N]
dry for gold, we need someone like you.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Big Brick, you're[N]
leaving us, aren't you?[A]
[1LB][MR]
[Beat]What makes you say that?[A]
[2LB][ML]
You don't need to train me as a potential[N]
leader of the boys if you're staying.[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] Yeah, I was planning on leaving.[N]
Got some personal matters back home.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
But the boys need you! You led us towards[N]
honest work. You gave us a real future![AN]
[MR]
There's no future in an organisation[N]
that depends on one person, Hakman.[AN]
Soon, the boys'll look at you like[N]
you look at me. Just give it time.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] I hope so.[N]
I really hope so.[AN]
[2LB][FFL][LoadLua]
Unknown enemies trying[N]
to get into the base![AN]
[FFR][LoadDesiderio]
Someone get Big Brick![N]
And the boss![AN]
[MR]
We'll talk about the future later.[N]
Let's get this out of the way, leader![A]
[ML]
R-Right! Follow my lead, everyone![A][X]

## TheDuke1
[L][LoadTheDuke]
[L]
We're under attack? I- I didn't think-[N]
Oh God. Stay calm, Mike. Don't panic.[A][X]

## MrMist1
[L][LoadMrMist]
[L]
I didn't hear of this raid, so it must[N]
be the rebels trying to get an upper hand.[AN]
I'll just wait this one out and sneak out[N]
with the documents when they're distracted.[A][X]

## Yaoguai1
[L][LoadYaoguai]
[L]
Must be an empire raid[Beat] I suppose they[N]
are truly sick of working with Jozef.[AN]
What a good opportunity! No one will[N]
notice a missing schematic in the chaos.[A][X]

## Jozef1
[L][LoadJozef]
[L]
What is this? What are the security doing?[N]
No, no, no! My investment! Guards, guards![A][X]

## Jozef2
[ML][LoadJozef][MR][LoadTheCloser]
[MR]
I take it, Mr Jozef, that you accept[N]
the terms of our working agreement?[AN]
That we are not liable for any losses,[N]
and that we are to be paid immediately?[AN]
[ML]
Yes! Yes! I don't care about that now![N]
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY! STOP THEM![AN]
[MR]
Very well. We will try to[N]
the utmost of our ability.[A][X]

## Jozef3
[ML][LoadJozef][MR][LoadTheCloser]
[MR]
A shame. It appears they escaped.[N]
I must still ask for the agreed payment.[A]
[ML]
Payment? PAYMENT? They got[N]
away! What do I pay you for?[AN]
[3LB][MR]
These were the terms of our contract.[N]
I'm to be paid regardless of success.[N]
Did you not read the contract in full?[AN]
[2LB][ML]
They were smashing my place up![N]
You think I had the time?[AN]
[MR]
I do not see how that is my concern.[N]
The agreed total is written down here.[AN]
[ML]
W-W-What? This much? This is daylight[N]
robbery! You can't be serious![AN][CSS]
[FL][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1][L][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MR]
Breaking a contract with[N]
me is[Beat] ill-advised.[AN]
[ML][1LB]
F-Fine! Damn it![AN]
[2LB][MR]
Thank you for your business.[N]
May your future be prosperous.[AN]
[MR][ClearFace]
[FL][ClearFace]
[L][ClearFace]
[ML]
Prosperous? PROSPEROUS! They just robbed[N]
me of as much gold as those thieves did![AN]
All my life, I've done nothing less than my[N]
best to get out of the gutter of my birth.[AN]
Took the most undesirable, dangerous jobs[N]
in the guild just to get through the door.[AN]
Trapped between the Empire and rebels,[N]
bribing and begging to keep myself alive.[AN]
Treated with scorn on the Isle for earning[N]
my wealth, rather than inheriting it.[AN]
Don't I deserve to be rewarded for my[N]
tenacity, facing impossible odds?[AN]
Why do good men struggle when all that[N]
they work for is so easily taken away?[AN]
Those corrupt guards, those thieves[Beat][N]
I won't let you go unpunished! I won't![A][X]

## WeWin
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
I wonder how Jozef is feeling right now.[N]
Never could take losses gracefully.[AN]
[MR]
At least the man got away with his[N]
life. Not all our enemies can say that.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
He won't be able to for long, either.[AN]
He's lost the majority of his wealth,[N]
and without it, his fair-weather friends[N]
won't stick around to watch his back.[AN]
With how many enemies he's made,[N]
Jozef'll be dead by year's end.[AN]
[MR]
Can't say I'm sympathetic. I'm curious,[N]
though. What'd the man do to piss you[N]
off so much? Must've been real bad.[AN]
[ML]
You want to hear my oh-so tragic tale?[AN]
[MR]
Sure. The job's done, ain't it?[N]
No better time to relish over[N]
takin' him down a peg, in my view.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Fine, then. I've mentioned my final,[N]
unfortunate voyage before, haven't I?[N]
Well, I wasn't the only one on it.[AN]
Other merchants in the guild joined me,[N]
but safety in numbers didn't help us.[AN]
Against a fleet that we couldn't outrun[N]
or outgun, Jozef came up with a plan.[AN]
[MR]
Doesn't sound like you liked it, boss.[AN]
[ML]
No, but it was a sound one. A good vessel[N]
would distract the pirates while everyone[N]
else fleed. The sacrifice of one for many.[AN]
[Beat]Naturally, I was chosen. I learned[N]
later that Jozef had planned this from[N]
the start, in case things went south.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Pathetic. Good riddance to him, then.[N]
Still, this job didn't have much in the[N]
way of payment. A word to the wise, boss.[AN]
[ML]
Mm? What is it, Desiderio?[A]
[MR]
I quieted folks down, but not everybody[N]
wanted to go along with today's job.[N]
High risk and low pay don't go together.[AN]
If it happens once or twice, then not[N]
much'll come of it[Beat] But pirates ain't[N]
all that loyal. Might be a shock, I know.[AN]
[ML]
You're suggesting[Beat] They'd mutiny?[A]
[MR]
Nah. Well, not now. The crew likes you[N]
well enough, and you've done right by us.[AN]
[Beat]Look, I know you wanted to get even.[N]
Hell, I woulda done the same. Just[Beat][N]
Remember that we're a crew, not a you.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Fair enough. We ended up making out[N]
well enough with these strange weapons,[N]
so hopefully, they'll all be satisfied.[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Aye, I'm sure they will. And hey,[N]
if you wanna make 'em more happy,[N]
why not give us all a free round at-[AN]
[ML]
Nice try, but no. You want booze?[N]
Then you're buying, Desiderio.[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Rats[Beat] There goes today's pay.[AN][X]
