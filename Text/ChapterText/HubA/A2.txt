// Beginning Scene: Leonor and her crew have been withstanding a siege for some time. Felipe, who was held back by Sierra's urgings from the siege, notices a pirate ship soaring
// in from the distance. All excited and worried that the pirates are in league with the rebels to help them escape, Felipe marches in on his own and commands Sierra to take the
// northern position despite her job being to guard him (and despite this risking civilian lives,). Exasperated, she accepts it and calls in Manfred, saying that it's time to raid
// the village if Felipe is charging in. Manfred relishes over the chance to commit violence, to Sierra's disgust, and then he leaves. Sierra then sends a messenger to the center
// of town, warning the mayor that if he harbors rebels any longer, then he and everyone inside will pay the price. Then, she sends a message to headquarters, calling on all available TORCH.

// We pan to Leonor's crew, who's been suddenly cast out by the mayor and left on her own. Her rebels have scattered, some are killed holding off the enemy, and Leonor is pressed on
// her recent failures, as if her heart isn't in it anymore. Leonor seems near ready to give up entirely, tired of how pointless everything that she's done feels.
// Then, Jaime arrives with Lua in tow, and he bolsters everyone's spirit and says that they finally have aid. Lua sees the situation and surmises that by the time everyone's loaded
// onto the ship, the enemy will be able to catch up and blow a hole in it with their siege magi. That means that they have no choice but to fight.

// Exhausted, Leonor agrees but cedes all command to Lua, tired of

Leonor Diaz! Rebel scum! You are surrounded![N]
Surrender now, or be annihilated![AN]
[MidRight]
Annihilated? We can beat you Incendivis[N]
pawns with one hand tied behind our backs![AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph. I see you're not going to listen to[N]
reason, so you leave me no choice![AN]
Don't let our siege mages hit[N]
you on your way back![AN]

Son of a--[AN][X]

[FFL][LoadLeonor][MoML]
[MR][LoadRebel][1LB]
Boss![A] Are you alright?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
I'm fine.[AN]
I think they were trying[N]
to intimidate us.[AN]
Those siege magi were just firing[N]
warning shots[Beat]of course.[AN]
[MR]
Glad you didn't get hit there[Beat][AN]
But it seems like the odds[N]
for us here aren't great.[AN]
They've got multiple siege mages, and[N]
they hired the Crimson Hearts[Beat][AN]
[ML][3LB]
If we're captured, we'll be executed at best.[N]
Better to go out fighting, in my opinion.[N]
Plus, if we can take out some of those[AN]
Crimson Heart villains, that'll be a service[N]
to the world. They slaughter and pillage[N]
without mercy wherever they go.[AN]
I just hope Jaime arrives with help in time[Beat][AN]
[X]

[MidLeft][LoadManfred][MidRight][LoadRedFighter]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]and then I cut his arm off and[N]
said, [OpenQuote]How's that for payin' me tab?"[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Gwah hah hah! That was a great story,[N]
boss. [Beat]Man, I can't believe we're[N]
workin' for the stinkin' empire again.[AN]
Their jobs are always so borin'.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, they pay well, and we're runnin' low on[N]
doubloons. Plus, they gave us permission to[N]
do anything, as long as we complete the job.[AN]
[MidRight][1LB]
Anything, eh? This might be fun[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2PrePrepsCutscene4
[MidLeft][LoadSierra][MidRight][LoadFelipe]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Felipe[Beat] Are you going to stay close to[N]
me? I'd hate for you to be hurt[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
On the contrary, I'd rather us be apart.[N]
That way, we can attack from both sides,[N]
assuring our victory! A good plan, no?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] It's certainly a plan[Beat][N]
I still insist that you'd be safer with my[N]
protection.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, is one of my soldiers lovestruck?[N]
How cute, but my parents don't approve[N]
of relationships with commoners.[AN]
[TextSpeed][0x1]
I can certainly see how one could fall[N]
in love with my glorious self, however,[N]
given how I have both noble grace and[N]
legendary skill with a spear. It is[N]
sincerely regretful that I must confine[N]
myself to high society for potential[N]
mates, but that is just how it is.[N]
Furthermore, *continuous inane[N]

idiot to shut up without telling him[N]
I'm his bodyguard[Beat]?)[AN]

[Left][LoadJaime][Right][LoadLeonor][FarLeft][LoadLua][FarRight][LoadRebel]
[Left][1LB]
Commander Leonor![AN]
[Right][3LB]
Jaime! You came! [Beat]And with what[N]
looks to be a pirate crew? I'd rather[N]
have more reliable rescuers[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Come on! Look, do you want to be saved[N]
or not? These were the only ones[N]
who would take the mission![AN]
[Right]
Well, I still don't trust them.[N]
I suppose that they're better[N]
than getting slaughtered, though.[AN]
[FarLeft]
If you're done insulting me and my crew,[N]
can we hurry up and leave? I'd rather not[N]
fight such a large force if I can avoid it.[AN]
[Left]
Are you serious? With your crew,[AN]
we can strike a serious blow[N]
to the empire and make a getaway[N]
when the tide turns against us![AN]
Not like your ship's going any- LOOK OUT![AN][Events]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Damn, that's a big hole.[AN]
I didn't expect them to use heavy guns here,[N]
and now there's no way we can fly[N]
with the ship in this state.[AN]
[FarRight][1LB]
Um[Beat] You may not be finished yet.[AN]
[FarLeft][1LB]
What are you on about?[AN]
[FarRight][3LB]
I was a shipbuilder before I joined[N]
the rebels, and I could probably repair[N]
the damage without enemies right here.[AN]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Sounds like our only option.[AN]
Everyone, defeat Incendivis's leaders[N]
to send their army into disarray![AN]
Then, we'll have this man fix the ship[N]
and fly before reinforcements come![A]
[Right]
Do what she says, boys![N]
We need every blade we can get![AN][X]

## A2Village
[MidLeft][LoadVillager][MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][3LB]
So the mayor's given up the fight[Beat][AN]
Bah! Commander Leonor's tried so[N]
hard to liberate us, and now,[N]
the bastard wants to give up?[AN]
Well, he can throw in the towel,[N]
but I won't! You're with the commander,[N]
right? Here, take this staff with you.[AN]
Might save a life or two, if you've[N]
got someone skilled enough to use it.[N]
Now, you'd best be off. Give 'em hell![AN][X]

## A2Ending1
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Well, that takes care of that.[AN]
All of the soldiers are retreating,[N]
now that we killed their commanders[Beat][N]
Huh?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadFelipe]
[MidRight][1LB]
Urghh[Beat] What a humiliating loss[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
How are you still alive? Ah, well,[N]
we can fix tha-[.4] Hey, you look familiar.[N]
Aren't you the son of Count G[á]lvez?[AN] // I just stole a name from a random spanish noble family
[MidRight][1LB]
M-My father will be furious with you![AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
How did you even get out here?[AN]
It's well-known that your[N]
family lives about as far[N]
away from here as you can get![AN]
Also, why are you a soldier?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
I distinguished myself with my superior[N]
abilities and was appointed to lead[N]
this battalion, obviously.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Yeah, just keep telling yourself that.[N]
Your father'll pay a good sum[N]
to get you back, that's for sure.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
I won't let you disgrace my name[N]
like that! I'll take you down with me![AN]
Hyaaargh![AN][CSS]
[MidRight][MoveFarFarLeft][Events]
[MidLeft][3LB]
That wasn't even close.[AN]
I suppose I don't have to account[N]
for all of the cliff-jumping fools[N]
in the world[Beat][AN]
[X]

## A2Ending2
[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadLeonor]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]Phew, that was a close one.[N]
We completed our mission, though.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hey, thanks for helping me out back[N]
there. I hope we meet again[Beat][AN]
[Left][LoadPilar]
[Left][1LB]
*whispering*[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Oh? [Beat]Well, it seems there's been[N]
a change of plans. Looks like I'll be[N]
joining your crew til things calm down.[AN]
The empire's looking for me, you know.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Thank you. (Pilar, how did you do[N]
that?)[AN]
[X]

## A2Ending2NoLeonor
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Phew, that was a close one.[N]
Unfortunate that we didn't save[N]
the cleric, but at least we survived.[AN]
The rest of the rebels seem to want[N]
to join us, seeing as we saved their[N]
lives, so at least we got something.[AN][X]

## CarmenJaimeConvo
[MidLeft][LoadJaime][MidRight][LoadCarmen]
[MidRight][3LB]
Hm[Beat] Hold a moment, you.[N]
Your name is Jaime, yes?[N]
And yet, you look familiar[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you don't look familiar to me.[N]
Maybe you're just seeing things in[N]
the heat of battle. Speaking of which-[AN]
[MR]
Aha! Now I remember! You're not Jaime;[N]
you're Hector! Hector del Rias, yes?[N]
It's been quite some time, cous-[AN]
[ML]
Keep it the hell down, will you?![N]
Obviously, no one here knows,[N]
so I'd appreciate it if you shut up.[AN]
[MR]
I could be convinced, with the proper[N]
incentive[Beat] But why leave home, Hector?[N]
You had everything that you could want.[AN]
You could have inherited the del Rias[N]
fortune[Beat] Why leave to play rebel?[AN]
[ML]
I'm not playing at anything, Carmen.[AN]
Look, we don't have time to talk about[N]
this, right now. Just know that I'm[N]
where I wanna be, doing what I wanna do.[AN]
Now, get back to the fight and keep your[N]
head on straight. I don't wanna spend[N]
all my time making sure you're safe.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Ha! Protecting me won't be necessary,[N]
Jaime. I've become quite an excellent[N]
pirate. Allow me to show you my mettle![A][X]

## A2GameOver
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Damn it! Just by looking at them,[N]
I can tell we'll never beat those[N]
troops. Is this really how it ends[Beat]?[AN][X]

## Ch2JaimeTip
[ML][LoadJaime]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
Hey, captain! A word?[A]
[MR]
Make it quick, unless you want[N]
them to get the jump on us.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
You see those mages they've got hiding[N]
in the back? They've kept us holed up,[N]
but now, it's time to counterattack![AN]
I'm pretty quick on the draw, see.[N]
No matter how far away an enemy is,[N]
I can always hit 'em right back![A]
[MR]
You must have some insane reflexes[Beat][N]
But no bulk to take the shots, eh?[AN]
[ML]
If it's magic, I'll do just fine.[N]
Though I'd still appreciate[N]
a pure draught of holy water[Beat][AN]
Well, whatever. Use my skills however[N]
you see fit, but don't waste them.[N]
Otherwise, we might die here after all.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Hmph[Beat] Underestimating us, aren't you?[N]
We haven't survived this long by luck.[N]
You'll get what you paid for, Jaime![A][X]

## Ch2SierraChargeText
[ML][LoadSierra]
And Felipe's strategies went as poorly[N]
as expected[Beat] I've seen enough.[AN]
Forget his orders. I'm going in![A][X]

## A2GameOverHugo
[MidLeft][LoadHugo][3LB][ToggleSmile]
This is the place with all the ruckus,[N]
eh? The marines stationed here must[N]
not be worth much[Beat] Well, whatever.[AN]
I've been waiting for a chance to scrap[N]
since I got my promotion, so I should[N]
be thankin' those losers, really.[AN]
Listen up, boys! It's TORCHin' time![N]
Pirates, rebels, whoever these folks[N]
are[Beat] Take 'em in, or wipe 'em out![AN][X]

## A2GameOverLua
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
TORCH is here? This quickly? Shit![AN]
There's no way that we can escape[N]
before they catch up to us[Beat][N]
I never should've taken this damn job.[AN][CloseEyes]
I'm sorry, everyone. This is the end[N]
of our journey[Beat] and it's my fault[Beat][AN][X]
