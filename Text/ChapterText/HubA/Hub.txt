//Hub A of Pirate Project
//Scenario: The crew arrives in Port Greagor and heads to port to sell the boat (first go-around).
//Various events occur in Port Greagor, and Hermenegildo/Estelle join you in the first run through the hub.
//Second and afterwards ones don't have the initial scene and just have hub events, changing every two chapters.

## HubATitle
Hub A - Port Greagor[X]

## HubAStatusObjective
 Explore Port Greagor[N]
 and gather doubloons.[X]

## HubAGoalWindow
Explore[X]

## HubTutorial
In Hub chapters, Lua can move freely[N]
and explore the area her crew is in.[AN]
There are various events in each area,[N]
and some may change along with the[N]
number of chapters completed.[AN]
Also, blue tiles will allow Lua[N]
to traverse around the hub area.[N]
For now, follow the blue tiles![A][X]

## HubTutorial2
Now that Lua's business is finished,[N]
she can move freely about the hub[N]
and decide on what course to chart.[AN]
Red tiles indicate people or places[N]
that will initiate a new chapter.[AN]
Once completed, Lua's crew will return[N]
to the hub. The remaining chapters will[N]
increase in difficulty to match this.[AN]
Once all of the chapters tied to a hub[N]
are completed, Lua's crew will be able[N]
to leave and move onto the next hub.[A][X]

## HubAGoTime
With all of Lua's business finished,[N]
she readies to move on from Port Greagor.[AN]
Follow the green tiles to the staircase[N]
in Lua's quarters to move onto Chapter 2.[A][X]

[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]Ho, Lua! Let me bend your[N]
ear a wee bit longer.[AN]
[MR]Let me guess. Need me to pay[N]
off your tab again, old man?[AN]
Last I checked, my coffers were[N]
as empty as your guild's soul.[AN]
[ML]Don't take that tone with me, young woman.[AN]
If I felt like it, I could sell your crew[N]
out to the Incendivisi for a pretty penny.[AN]
[3LB]
[MR]As if. The bounty on us right now is[N]
worth jack squat compared to the booty[N]
that we've raided from their ships.[AN]
You wouldn't pass up the chance to get[N]
in on that, if only for just a sliver.[AN]
[ML]Ha! You're right - I wouldn't dream[N]
of taking the wind out of your sails.[AN]
And, as it so happens, I've got a job[N]
for you and your crew.[AN]
[MR]Spill it. You know we're not[N]
exactly built for honest work.[AN]
[ML]Did I ever take you to the Merchant's[N]
Faire back when you were under my wing?[AN]
[MR]More than once, though they all[N]
blur together as the years go by.[AN]
You taught me to count, but my head still[N]
spins for every zero beyond a million.[AN]
If you ask me, all those nobles' bidding[N]
is just them overcompensating for-[AN]
[ML]Alright, alright, save your breath[N]
for a speech I haven't heard before.[AN]
Ever heard of the island of Balinok?[AN]
[MR]Only from your mouth, when you were[N]
praising the quality of its liquor.[AN]
What do they have to do with the[N]
Merchant's Faire, and with us?[AN]
[3LB]
[ML]Well, about a week ago Incendivis got[N]
a tip that the Balinokos were harboring[N]
rebel activity.[A] They launched a raid on[N]
the islanders, and a noble from House[N]
Sanz swooped in to loot in the aftermath.[AN]
He stole some priceless relics from the[N]
island and is planning to put them up[N]
for auction during the Merchant's Faire.[AN]
[2LB]
[MR]Typical for that scum. I take it your ever-so[N]
bleeding heart won't stand for this?[AN]
[ML]Damn straight![A] The Balinokan chief and I[N]
met in secret, and we made a deal.[AN]
In exchange for a lifetime supply of their[N]
lambanog, I'll recover their relic.[AN]
And your crew will be the ones to break[N]
into House Sanz's guardhouse to do it.[AN]
[MR]So you've signed us up for a dangerous[N]
job that pisses the nobles off,[AN]
all without a penny going to us.[AN]
[ML]Hey, I at least planned your[N]
payment ahead of time.[AN]
If you break into the guardhouse,[N]
you can plunder as much as you like.[AN]
Who knows just what other rarities[N]
he was planning to sell at the Faire?[AN]
So what do you say, Lua?[N]
Will you take the job?[A][X]

A Balinokan shaman will arrive to[N]
fill you in on the finer details.[AN]

Listen to me, damn it! I know pirates[N]
don't care about anything but gold,[N]
so I'm willing to pay a great deal.[AN]
So long as you save the commander[Beat][N]
No price is too great for that.[AN]

[Beat]Who is it that you want saved?[AN]
[ML]
Commander Leonor, the boss of our group.[AN]
We're not exactly a big band or anything,[N]
but we've done enough strikes on empire[N]
bases around here to get noticed.[AN]
Turns out, there's two forces headed[N]
right for us[Beat] Imperial Marines,[N]
and some freakish mercs they've hired.[AN]

Sure, any merchant worth their salt has.[N]
Saves a lot of time sailing from the[N]

Why not leverage that to prey on some[N]

You see, I hired another crew to deliver[N]

Precisely! I'll tag along, of course,[N]

For me, trying to come up with names[N]
is like you trying to eat your carrots.[A]
[L]
Oh, come on, I eat my carrots just fine.[N]
It's the greens that don't go down easy[Beat][N]
But you know what the common thread is?[AN]
We may not like it, but it's good for us.[AN]
A name's somethin' that can be feared or[N]
revered among our fellow lawbreakers,[N]
and it's the captain's job to make one.[AN]
[MR]
Bold words for someone who ran from home[N]
over not wanting to eat his veggies[Beat][N]
Not that I believe that. Fine, you win.[AN]
I'll think of something when we get back.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
[Beat]Are you two done now? Good.[N]
We should split up here, Lua.[AN]
Desiderio and I can dock the new ship[N]
at Port Greagor while you head back.[AN]
Make sure Hermenegildo has not burned[N]
the place down in our absence, hm?[AN]
[MR]
The man's not that incompetent[Beat][N]
I hope. But you're right, Pilar.[AN]
Desiderio, deal with potential buyers[N]
and let me know if anyone's interested.[AN]
Pilar, keep watch on the surroundings[N]
to make sure no one steals it from us.[AN]
[L]
You got it, boss![N]
Just don't forget our cut.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
We will not fail you.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
Now, back to home sweet home[Beat][AN]
I just hope that idiot did his[N]
job, or there'll be hell to pay.[A][X]

[ML][LoadLua]
We're here, Razvan. Did you gather[N]
all your belongings from the ship?[AN]
[MR]
Of course I did! I had my bags[N]
packed hours ago, Captain Lua.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Heh. That eager to get back on land?[N]
You need to work on your sky legs,[N]
or you'll never cut it as a pirate.[AN]
[MR]
Well, I don't intend to stay a pirate,[N]
but you have a point, regardless.[AN]
If I can't handle riding on an airship,[N]
it'll be difficult to accomplish my goals.[N]
Thank you for reminding me, captain![AN]
[ML]
You're too damned serious, Razvan[Beat][N]
It's time for a well-deserved break.[N]
Care to accompany me to the port?[AN]
I could use a helping hand to carry[N]
some purchases, and you could use[N]
real experience with a pirate's life.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]I would rather not have[N]
that experience, to be honest.[AN]
[ML]
Are you sure? I'll have plenty of gold[N]
once I sell a few of our recent scores.[AN]
Perhaps even enough for your favorite[Beat][AN]
[MR][1LB]
W-What? You couldn't mean-[.4] turr[ó]n?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Oh, I do. Almond paste, honey, and even[N]
more sugar[Beat] Thinking about it makes[N]
my teeth ache, but you're young enough.[AN]
Consider it your reward for excellent[N]
work during our little journey, Razvan.[AN]
[MR]
Captain, I[Beat] No! I won't be tempted![AN]
Thank you, truly, but I must decline.[N]
I want as little to do with pirates[N]
as possible, outside of your crew.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Fair enough, Razvan.[N]
I'll just eat it myself[Beat][AN][Event]

Captain! It is oh so wonderful[N]
to see that you have returned,[N]
unharmed! Might I carry your luggage?[AN]
[L]
Oh, it's just you, Hermen.[N]
You took a long while to greet us[Beat][N]
What if we were intruders, instead?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
I-I was watching the front door,[N]
just like you told me to, captain![AN]
But, since it is so far from here,[N]
I could not hear your grand arrival.[AN]
[L]
Hm[Beat] Well, I'm satisfied that the[N]
place seems to have survived our trip.[AN]
Consider the debt reduced by a thousand[N]
doubloons for your service, Hermen.[AN]
That leaves nine thousand for you to pay[N]
to compensate the cost those Rioja Reapers[N]
demanded. All to make you a free man[Beat][AN]
A bit overpriced, if you ask me,[N]
but you're a knowledgeable fellow.[N]
You've proven yourself very useful.[AN]
[FL]
Thank you so much, c-captain![N]
I will continue to do all that I can[N]
to work off that debt, so[Beat][AN]
Might I receive a tome,[N]
to better aid you in battle?[AN]
[L][2LB]
If you want me to add it to your tab,[N]
then sure. I'll buy any tome you like.[AN]
[FL]
N-Never mind, then. I can wait until[N]
my debt is fully paid off for that.[AN]
[MR]
Mr. Hermenegildo, I'm interested[N]
in learning how to use tomes myself,[AN]
so that I'm less of a burden here[Beat][N]
Please, would you teach me your ways?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Hm. Well, learning tomelore is quite[N]
demanding, boy. I am not sure whether[N]
a child from the outskirts can learn-[AN]
[L]
That's a fine idea, Razvan. Hermen,[N]
if you agree, I'll knock two thousand[N]
off of your debt if it bears fruit.[AN]
[FL][TS]
[Beat]But you are such an intelligent lad,[N]
that I believe you can do anything![N]
With enough instruction, that is.[AN]
Come now, let us retreat to the library.[N]
I will teach you all that I learned in the[N]
capital, out of the goodness of my heart![A]
[MR][2LB]
Really? Thank you so much, sir![N]
I won't betray your faith in me.[A][X]

[Beat]Not an imperial guardsman in sight,[N]
sticking their nose out like pigs,[N]
and this place's all the better for it.[AN]
The guilds technically run the show,[N]
sure, but they're too busy arguing with[N]
each other to worry about any pirates.[AN]
So long as we keep things clean here[N]
and don't break any of the codes that[N]
the Greagor Five's leaders have set,[AN]
there's no better place to do business.[AN]
[Beat]Now, let me take a look at the haul.[AN]
Once I subtract all the journey's costs,[N]
the wages of my crew, and the rest[Beat][N]
I've got 7000 gold for myself.[AN]

for Razvan's pastry, just like I thought.[A][X]

Well, look what the cat dragged in.[N]
I'd been wondering whether you got[N]
shanked on your way here, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
Come on, you know that I'm too tough[N]
for something like that to stop me.[N]
To what do I owe the pleasure, Ida?[AN]
It's not every day that the leader[N]
of the Shipwrights Guild and the[N]
Greagor Five talks to someone like me.[AN]
[ML]
I'm a busy woman, so cut the snark.[N]
An odd fellow down by the docks is[N]
looking for you, by your man[Beat][AN]
Desiderio, was it? They seem to be[N]
in some kind of dispute over something.[AN]
[MR]
An odd fellow? He must be strange indeed[N]
to look that way to you, since you've[N]
seen all sorts of people in this port.[AN]
Thanks for letting me know, Ida.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Well, I'll be on my way.[AN]
[MR]
Ah, hold on a moment.[N]
I have a request for you.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Of course you do.[N]
Out with it, then.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
The Liberator took a beating during[N]
our last expedition. Desiderio and I[N]
can't fix it ourselves, I'm afraid,[AN]
so would you mind sending a carpenter[N]
to our cove? I'll pay well, of course.[N]
My ship's worth any price I can afford.[A]
[ML]
You better be, if I'm sending one of my[N]
people to a pirate den[Beat] Fine, I have[N]
a protege in mind who can handle it.[AN]
Pay me two thousand gold, upfront.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
A steep price[Beat] but you've never[N]
let me down before. Here you are.[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Good. A girl named Rahel will be there[N]
within the hour. A pleasure, as always.[A][X]

## HubABeginningScene3_3
[MR][LoadLua]
That woman never smiles unless[N]
she's got gold in hand, does she?[AN]
No wonder she made it to the top.[AN]

[MR][LoadLua]
Ah, Pilar. Any issues nearby our[N]

[MR][LoadSailor]
[MR]
Didn't you hear me the first time?[N]
You're mad, woman! Get off my ship![AN]

[Beat]Very well. If that is what you[N]
wish, I will leave without delay.[A][X]

## HubABeginningScene4_3
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
Looks like that girl's trying to gain[N]
passage[Beat] Well, none of our concern.[AN]
[ML]
Unlikely, Lua.[N]
She seems to have spotted us.[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] Any chance that you'll[N]
deal with it for me, Pilar?[AN]

None. You represent the crew,[N]
not me. The call is yours.[AN][X]

## HubABeginningScene4_4
[MR][LoadLua]
[L][LoadPilar]
[FL][LoadEstelle]
[MR]Let's have it, then.[N]
What do you want, girl?[A]
[FL]
Simply to ask a question, miss.[N]
Would you happen to be a pirate?[AN]
[MR]
And if I am?[AN]
[FL]
Please, let me come aboard your ship![AN]
I'll do anything that you ask of me,[N]
so long as you fulfill my wish.[AN]
[MR]
Your wish? Slow down a bit, lass.[AN]
For the right price, I might agree,[N]
but what exactly do you want?[AN]
I'm assuming it isn't just[N]
sailing the skies, right?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]What do you think of the stars?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well[Beat] I've passed many evening watches[N]
looking up at the stars in the sky.[N]
I imagine most sailors have.[AN]
Beyond that, I can't say I have[N]
any strong feelings about them.[N]
They're just there, always.[AN]
[FL]
I see[Beat] However, I am not satisfied[N]
merely looking up at their visage.[AN]
I desire nothing less than to visit[N]
them myself, upon an airship![AN]
Such is what I told that sailor,[N]
but he scoffed at my dream.[AN]
I was nearly about to give up hope,[N]
but I believed in my divination[N]
that a pirate would come to my aid.[AN]
And now, here you are, Miss Lua.[N]
It feels like fate, does it not?[AN]
[MR]
When did I give you my name?[N]
And[Beat] Did you say divination?[N]
As in, seeing the future?[AN]
[FL]
I know many things that I should not.[AN]
Were you to let me join your merry band,[N]
I could use my ability as you command[Beat][N]
Though I admit, it is not always reliable.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
And I admit that I'm having a hard time[N]
believing your claims, but[Beat][AN]
What do you think of them, Pilar?[AN]
[L]
It would be best not to judge from[N]
the lens of one raised in the Empire.[AN]
Out in these isles, and even beyond,[N]
the impossible can become very real[Beat][AN]
[L]
[MR][1LB]
Hm[Beat] What's your name, lass?[AN]
[ML]
You may call me Estelle.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
To tell you the truth, I have no idea[N]
how to sail an airship that far up.[N]
Anyone that's tried has crashed first.[AN]
If you still want to join us knowing that,[N]
then I'll let you, on one condition.[AN]
You'll have to pull your own weight,[N]
with or without your divinations.[N]
Pilar, can you show her the ropes?[A]
[L]
Of course. Listen to me, Estelle.[N]
The captain may doubt your goals,[N]
but anything can happen in this world.[AN]
Many of the outer isles still remain[N]
unexplored[Beat] Perhaps even one similar[N]
to your dream lies waiting for you.[AN]
But to get there, you'll need to work[N]
for it. Nothing comes easy when you're[N]
a crewmate on the Liberator, understand?[AN]
[FL]
Of course. Thank you so much, Miss Pilar![N]
And you as well, Miss[Beat] Captain Lua![AN]
I promise that I will be of service.[N]
In fact, I had payment in mind, but[Beat][N][MoFL][MoFL]
Oh, I just cannot find it anywhere![AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Well, you'll pay plenty in elbow grease.[N]

but welcome to the crew, Estelle.[AN]

Oh? But what if I decide to purchase[N]
another, instead? I suspect your[N]

She might be, true, but she'd put me[N]
in shackles if I did what you want.[N]
I'll take some mean words over that.[AN]

Oh, you exaggerate far too much.[N]
Your captain and I go way back,[N]
and she was never a cruel mistress.[AN]

Surely that much is worth my coin?[AN][X]

[Beat]What are you doing here, Orlando?[N]
This is no place for a man like you.[AN]

Oh, you flatter me, Lua.[AN]
I was just looking for you,[N]
so I'm glad you showed up.[AN]

It wasn't a compliment.[AN]

[FR]
[Beat]Enough. You wouldn't come this far[N]
for pleasantries. What do you want?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I hoped that we could discuss old times[N]
and what brought you to these lawless[N]
isles. Perhaps over drinks, like always?[AN]
Ah, but such talk should be discreet.[N]
No disrespect to your servant here,[N]
but I don't trust him as I do you.[AN]
[R]
Servant? You've got the wrong idea, pal.[N]
I may be Lua's right hand, but I serve[N]
out of choice, not an obligation.[AN]
So, even if you're her old buddy,[N]
if you think you can disrespect me,[N]
I've got a fist with your name-[AN]
[FR]
Desiderio, don't! He's not worth it.[AN]
[Beat]You're as incomprehensible as always,[N]
Orlando. If you really want privacy,[N]
I have my own quarters back at my base.[AN]
But you're only coming as a potential[N]

But worry not, I will refrain.[N]
Is that girl in your employ?[AN]

Never seen her in my life,[N]

[ML][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Take a seat wherever you like, and[N]
let's get down to business, Orlando.[N]
Tell me why you're really here.[AN]
[ML]
Oh? Well, for starters, I would like[N]
to purchase that merchant galleon.[N]
Say[Beat] For five thousand gold, perhaps?[AN]
You could sell it a bit higher,[N]
but any observant individual will notice[N]
its[Beat] former uses, and ask questions.[AN]
[MR]
Seems like a fair price to me.[N]
But I asked why you're really here,[N]
and that isn't the answer, is it?[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Fair enough. To tell the truth,[N]
I heard tales of a swashbuckling pirate[N]
captain targeting merchants recently.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But not just any merchants, mind you.[N]
Reports say she targeted those deep[N]
in bed with the Imperial Marines.[AN]
When I think of pirates, I typically[N]
do not imagine them choosy about their[N]
targets, let alone as selective as that.[AN]
Well, perhaps one with a grievance[Beat][AN]
[MR][1LB]
So you thought of me?[A]
[ML][3LB]
Admittedly a bit of a reach,[N]
but I've always enjoyed a gamble.[N]
In any case, I come on guild business.[AN]
Your absence the past few months greatly[N]
impacted our operations, says the chief.[N]
He asked that you return to the fold.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
No.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
And I told him you would say that.[N]
Well, at least I tried, eh?[AN]
I have to admit that I was surprised[N]
when I saw you. In only a few months,[N]
you have become quite the pirate, Lua.[AN]
[Beat]I suppose the loss of your merchant[N]
ship fed your transformation into this.[N]
Such a tragedy[Beat] I can't imagine it.[AN]
[MR]
That was only the trigger, Orlando.[AN]
The thievery of my goods, and the marines[N]
refusing to save me from ruin[Beat][N]
Only a prelude that showed me the truth.[AN]
The empire's built on a house of cards,[N]
propped up by the wealth of the few[N]
and the tyranny of the marines.[AN]
But here, I'm free for once in my life.[N]
I don't plan on ever going back.[AN]
[ML]
I sympathize with your position, Lua,[N]
but are you truly satisfied with this?[AN]
The pirates in bedtime stories travel[N]
on grand adventures and find great[N]
treasure. But you[Beat] hunt merchants?[AN]
[MR][1LB]
What are you getting at?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
As it happens, quite a few interesting[N]
occurrences have manifested, as of late.[AN]
All related to mysterious movements[N]
of the Imperial Marines that you hate,[N]
in the direction of these very isles,[AN]
and further. It is rare enough to see[N]
a marine vessel out in these parts[Beat][N]
But as many as the rumors say?[AN]
They seek something, Lua.[N]
Perhaps even[Beat] the Fire Emblem.[A]
[MR]
Not this again, Orlando. The idea that[N]
some magical artifact raised these isles[N]
into the skies[Beat] It's nonsense, man.[AN]
Something I'd expect from a drunkard,[N]
not from a merchant of your standing.[AN]
[ML]
Oh, am I not allowed to dream?[AN]
At the very least, those marines[N]
are searching for something valuable[N]
in lands fraught with mystery.[AN]
Does that not excite your spirit?[N]
Would you not like to steal it,[N]
right from under their noses?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I'll have to ask the crew and mull[N]
it over before deciding whether we[N]
should go further into the outskirts.[AN]
We'll need more crewmates anyway,[N]
and the coin to pay and feed them,[N]
before we make that kind of push.[AN]
[ML]
Take all the time you like.[N]
I can provide coin, so long as you[N]
help me in return with my lodging.[AN]
[MR]
I doubt they're what you're used to,[N]
but I've got a few empty rooms down[N]
in the basement. Take your pick.[AN]
[ML]
If those are the best accomodations,[N]
then I suppose that is good enough.[AN]
It will take some time to unpack,[N]
so we can stop here for now, Lua.[N]
Please, give my words some thought.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
It's rare for him to stop talking[N]
voluntarily[Beat] Well, whatever.[AN]
He's got a point that things have[N]
gotten boring around here lately,[N]
so a change of pace might be good.[AN]
For now though, I should snoop[N]
around the port, expand the crew,[N]
and grab whatever gold I can find.[AN]
[Beat]And think of that damned name.[A][X]

[FR]Hells, look what you've done, Triana.[AN]
You've dragged an innocent bystander[N]
into our wreck of an argument.[AN]
[L]I'd sooner call this an opportunity![AN]
Excuse me, woman in the cool hat![N]
We need your help setting a dispute.[AN]
[FL]A dispute, you say. Well, I can[N]
hardly say without knowing you all.[AN]
What do you say to a round of[N]
drinks? All on me, of course.[AN]
[R]Wuh-Wuzzat? Someone say drinks?[AN]
[FR]Careful, stranger, you alerted Medwyn.[N]
Better not let him empty your coffers.[AN]
[R]Tsk[Beat] who needs your coffers?[AN]
I've got a whole fortune stowed[N]
away on an outskirt island[Beat][AN]
all I need is that blasted cargo[N]
captain' tell me where it is[Beat][AN]
[L]If the barkeep didn't believe you the[N]
first time, he's sure as hell not now.[AN]
This is Medwyn del Miron, and he lost[N]
his entire fortune to a scam artist.[AN]
[FR]It's poor form to introduce another[N]
before yourself first, Triana.[AN]

[FL]I never-[AN]

beg to feed and clothe yourself.[AN]
[FL]Anyway[Beat] what's this dispute[N]
you three were talkin about?[AN]
[L]As I'm sure you can glean, the[N]
three of us are[Beat] down on our luck.[AN]
[R]Maybe you two plebeians are, but me[Beat][AN]
Any day now, that ship'll come by and[N]
bring a hun'erd times the gold I paid![AN]
[FR]To dull the pain of our situations,[N]
the three of us created a wager.[AN]
Whichever of us can land a steady[N]
job first is the winner,[AN]
and the others must cope with it[N]
for the rest of their lives.[AN]
But not just any job will do.[AN]
[L]It must be one full of adventure,[N]
of sight-seeing and high thrills![AN]
[R]It must be one of opulence and[N]
great fortune for one's exploits![AN]
[FR]And it must be one that doesn't[N]
dare to lick Incendivis's boots.[AN]
Well, you've heard our dispute,[N]
stranger. What say you to it?[AN]

I'm not cut out for such heavy labor.[AN]
I was built for softer things in life:[N]
fluffy pillows, an emperor-sized bed.[AN]

when can I see a magical demonstration?[AN]
If I'm to one day cast tomes for myself,[N]

I was just on my way here to[N]

[L]Captain Lua! Master Hermenegildo spent[N]
the last hour lecturing me on history.[AN]
If it's not too much a bother, I want[N]
to start casting tomes as soon as I can.[AN]
[R]Patience, child. You- you have to grasp[N]
the fundamentals first! Yes, that's it![AN]
Although certainly, I wouldn't complain[N]
if the captain wanted to cover the cost.[AN]
[FL]I seem to recall a Light Brand in your[N]
possession when we dragged you in.[AN]
[R]M-my trusty Light Brand? But it's the[N]
only artifact legally belonging to me![AN]
Its mana is wasted on - party tricks[N]

Now, I have other business to attend to.[AN]

experienced enough to pick up a tome.[AN]
I'll gladly pay out of pocket for it.[AN]

[R]Ha! Isn't that the truth.[AN]
[FL][Beat]Anyway, how's progress on the ship?[AN]
Ida sent you alone. She must have[N]
high faith in your abilities.[AN]

makes for golden conversation.[AN]
A skill you could've stood to[N]
pick up in your apprenticeship.[AN]

attention to what you say, captain.[AN]

[L]This boatsmith's got a mind to[N]
kick us out of the damn port.[AN]

We'd contract your guild, lie low[N]
a few weeks, then sail on.[AN]
[R]That's too long a time, Lua.[N]
Incendivis just gave out an order:[AN]
all ports and merchants harboring[N]
dissidents will be TORCHed.[AN]

be running for your damn lives.[AN]
You hear about the Roseblades?[N]

[L]I'll fill in the story, captain.[AN]
When Rogelio sold out the Roseblades[N]
seven years ago, he sold out everyone.[AN]
Every port and merchant who helped[N]
us was put to the torch.[AN]
Burned to the ground: no trial, no[N]
negotiation, nothin' left behind.[AN]
[R]He has the right of it.[AN]
I built up the Greagor Five[N]
with my own two hands.[AN]
I'm not losing it to TORCH[N]
'cause of the likes of you:[AN]
a band of wet-behind-the-ears[N]
pirates without any sense.[AN]
[FL]In simpler terms, you want us to[N]
leave before we draw TORCH here.[AN]
[R]I want to support you, I really do.[AN]
But for the sake of my port, I can't[N]
take any chances, no matter how small.[AN]
Hell, I'm still not comfortable sending[N]
Rahel down to your damn pirate lair.[AN]

of all the stars in the night sky.[AN]

stars, I'd like you to have this.[AN]
