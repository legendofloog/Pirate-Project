[R][LoadLua]
[R]
[Beat]Anything to report[N]
up above, Pilar?[AN]
[L]
Take your guess, captain.[AN]
[R]
Unfortunate.[AN][CloseEyes]
Three days of scouring the skies,[N]
and no luck whatsoever.[AN][OpenEyes]
Are there really no other ships[N]
interested in this route?[AN]
[L]
It would seem so[Beat][AN]
At this rate, it may soon be time to[N]
cut our losses and return to port.[AN]
[R][3LB]
You may be right, Pilar.[AN]
As profitable as a supply raid[N]
on a merchant would be, it doesn't[N]
mean a thing if we can't find any.[AN]
[FL]
Hm. It still feels somewhat unusual[N]
to want to find trouble, instead[N]
of doing everything to avoid it.[AN]
I suppose I haven't yet adjusted[N]
to the life of a pirate, have I?[AN]
[R]
You'll get there, Razvan.[AN]
[FL]
I hope that I don't, captain.[AN]
Truly, the best time of my life[N]
was training under my mentor,[N]
studying stafflore in silence[Beat][AN]
[L]
That sounds[Beat] stifling.[N]
I would rather swab the Liberator's[N]
deck than hide away in a monastery.[AN]
[FL]
Ha! And I respect your opinion,[N]
Miss Pilar. But I learned much[N]
in that time, so I've no complaints.[AN]
[R]
You definitely must've. I've tried[N]
time and time again over the years[N]
to learn a bit of staffing myself,[AN]
but it's never really clicked.[N]
Must be my rotten soul, hm?[AN]
[FL]
Your soul's hardly rotten, captain.[N]
And besides, many with ill motives[N]
have used staves to those ends.[AN]
[L][ToggleSmile]
So Lua's lacking in talent, Razvan?[N]
A bold thing to say of your captain.[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
No, no! I mean, talent does matter,[N]
but dilligence matters much more.[AN]
There are other methods, as well[Beat][N]
Certain magical items can help[N]
[OQ]unlock" an individual's talent.[AN]
All of this is to say, don't give up![N]
I can even help teach you, captain.[N]
It's the least I could do to repay you.[AN]
[R]
Really? I'd like that, Razvan.[A]
[L]
Such an earnest young man, hm?[N]
He contrasts sharply with-[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[FR][LoadDesiderio]
Oi, boss[Beat] Or, hell,[N]
everyone's here, I guess.[AN]
[R]
What's the situation, Desiderio?[AN]
[FR]
Saw somethin' weird on the horizon.[N]
Gotta be a ship, but it's[Beat][N]
thicker than what you'd expect.[AN]
[R]
Thicker[Beat]? What do you mean by that?[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] There's gotta be a better[N]
word for it[Beat] Like, the shape's[N]
all weird and stuff. You know?[AN]
[L]
No, we don't know. What kind[N]
of wishy-washy description is that?[AN]
[FR]
Hey, it ain't my fault that you all[N]
decided to kick back below deck![N]
You wanna know? Follow me and see![AN]
[R]
Fair enough. Lead the way, Desiderio.[AN]

[FL]
Ah, in a moment, captain.[N]
Allow me to put away my books[N]
before joining you all topside.[AN][CSSCF]
[FR]
Hmm[Beat] Still lacking readiness.[N]
But I'll make you into a pirate yet,[N]
Razvan. It'll just take some time.[A][X]

## A4StartEventBase_2
[FL][LoadPilar]
[L][LoadDesiderio]
[L]
There, off in that direction.[AN]
Ship all the way off in the[N]
sky out there, higher in the air.[AN]
[FL]
Hmm[Beat] judging from the distance.[Beat][AN]
I'd say roughly twenty or so miles[N]
out. Half a mile of altitude.[AN]
[R][LoadLua]
[R]
Your aptitude for aeronautics[N]
is always impressive, Pilar.[AN]
[FL]
Ah, captain.[AN]
It was merely an estimate.[N]
No need for flattery here.[AN]
[R]
I'll go ahead and make[N]
the approach, then.[AN]
If it's a merchant ship, [N]
you all know the drill.[AN]
Greet them and see if they're [N]
affiliated with any imperials.[AN]
If they are, then demand the[N]
surrender of their goods![AN]
[L]
Of course, boss[Beat][AN]
Still, I gotta wonder why that[N]
shape looks so weird.[AN]
Isn't like any ship[N]
I've seen before[Beat][AN]
[FL]
Mm. Surprising as it was to me,[N]
your wishy-washiness was warranted.[AN]
That's a truly bizarre airship[Beat][N]
May I borrow your spyglass, Lua?[AN]
I'd like to take another look.[A]
[R][MoveRight]
Here you are, Pilar.[AN]
[FL]
One moment[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes][.4]
[L]
Tch, maybe it's one of those weird[N]
ships I've heard rumors about.[AN]
[FL][OpenEyes]
[R]
Oh? Rumors you say? [AN]
Busy drinking at a tavern, and[N]
found too many bits of gossip?[AN]
[L][3LB]
You know me too well, boss.[AN]
Talked to some drunk sailor about[N]
it at the port, so take their garbled[N]
word with a grain of salt[Beat][AN]
Some shipwrights're goin' bold with[N]
their designs and construction.[AN]
Unusual hull shapes, multi-deck[N]
design, physical wings attached[N]
to the ships, real stupid ideas[Beat][AN]
Hell, I even heard out there that[N]
some crew's trying to find a design[N]
stable enough to put cannon onboard.[AN]
[R][2LB]
Cannons onboard a ship?[N]
That crew must have a death wish.[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Alright, I've seen enough.[AN]
None of the crazy ideas that[N]
Desiderio's on about are relevant.[A]
[L]
What makes you say that, eh?[AN]
[FL]
It's not one just 'one' ship.[N]
Or a strangely shaped one.[AN]
[Event]//change music
[FL]
There are two ships, linked by[N]
grappling hooks and boarding planks.[AN]
[L][3LB]
Hell[Beat] Somebody else's doin'[N]
the plunderin' instead of us?[N]
Boss, you gonna let us get in on this?[AN]
[FL]
Slow down, Desiderio. Think it over.[N]
If both crews are hostile towards us,[N]
this could turn into quite the mess.[AN]
[L]
Yeah, but they clearly ain't fond[N]
of each other. What's it they say[Beat][N]
Divide and conquer? If we do that,[AN]
then we can get both their loot[N]
for half the price! Damn good deal, eh?[A]
[FL]
[Beat]Hm. Lua, what do you think?[A]
[R]
I think that the risk is worth it.[N]
Tell the crew to ready for combat;[N]
we're crashing this boarding party![AN]
[L]
Heh, you got it, boss! With me shoutin',[N]
they'll all come runnin' in a second.[AN]

Do you forget so easily, Razvan?[N]
You're a pirate now. And when pirates[N]

They're ravaged! Defenseless![N]
And you think they would try[N]

Striking them down while they're[N]
weakened is the safest path, for us.[AN]

And actually, ain't the safest path[N]

even duped some rebels into helpin'[Beat][AN]
With the way the Razorbloods looked, too![N]
At least the rebels wash themselves, ha![AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Is this really the time for banter?[N]
The imperial ship still demands our[N]
attention. Right, Captain Lua?[A]
[R]
Right. Razvan, you and I can investigate[N]
the other ship. Follow me carefully.[N]
They might have a surprise planned.[A]
[FR]
O-Of course! I'll stay alert, captain![A]
[R]
And as for you two[Beat] Have the crew[N]
secure the other two ships, will you?[AN]
[FL]
You got it, boss![N]
I'll make sure there aren't[N]
any rebels lurkin' about![AN]
[L]
And I'll do the same for the[N]
Razorbloods. Stay safe, Lua.[AN][X]

O Maker[Beat] These pirates rampaged[N]
without even a shred of remorse.[N]
So many bodies[Beat] Urp[Beat][A]
[R]
[Beat]Still not used to it, huh?[N]
These soldiers were probably as[N]
green as you, with a ship this small.[AN]
Didn't stand much of a chance against[N]
pirates, even the third-rate ones here.[A]
[FR]
As green as me[Beat] Yes, you're right.[N]
It could have been me on this ship,[N]
slaughtered and left to the buzzards.[AN]
Given we live a pirate's life, this[Beat][N]
This shouldn't shake me, yet it does.[N]
Apologies, captain. But I'm fine, now.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]If it's too much for you, then[N]
I can walk down and scope out[N]
the cabin myself while you wait here.[AN]
It'll probably just be more bodies-[A]

We haven't died just yet.[N]
I can assure you of that.[AN]

But it seems you've proven me wrong.[AN]
You folks defeated the pirates here,[N]
yes? Was it some kind of mutiny?[AN]
[FR]
No, ma'am. We're no Razorbloods.[N]
We[Beat] Uh[Beat] We happened[N]
to be in the area, I guess.[AN]
[R]
Right. We were delivering a shipment,[N]
but then, we saw the scuffle and tried[N]
to save as many lives as we could.[AN]

Thank you for saving our lives.[AN]

You're very welcome, miss![N]
It was quite the ordeal[Beat][AN]
Not only did we have to best[N]
the Razorbloods, but then,[N]
a group of rebels attacked![AN]
[L]
Oh, I suppose that answers my next[N]
question about the ship over there.[N]
You really fought off two crews[Beat]?[AN]
[R]
All in a day's work for us.[A]
[L]
Right[Beat] I somehow doubt that.[AN]
[FFL][LoadValerie]
Um[Beat] Is everything alright out there,[N]
captain? I-I've got my bow ready, if[N]
you need me to get out there and-[AN]
[L]
No need to, Val. Everything's fine[N]
up here. Some folks came to save us[Beat][N]
Everyone, come up here and thank them![A][X]

And for what? We're barely carrying[N]

O-Oh! Was I not supposed to say that?[AN]

M-Me? My name's Razvan.[A]

[ML]
H-Huh? But isn't that a heal staff[N]
that you're holding, right now?[AN]
[MR]
It's more of a sentimental staff[Beat][N]
You see, it was a gift from my mother.[AN]
When I first became a curate proper,[N]
she gave this to me. My first real staff.[AN]
But its mana has long since dissipated[Beat][N]
I couldn't use it even if I wanted to.[N]
I'm, um[Beat] Well, I'm useless, right now.[A]

Wow[Beat] E-Er, I'm not wowing in[N]

[L][LoadA4ImperialCaptain][3LB]
Heh[Beat] An eager one, isn't he?[AN]
It heartens me to see that not[N]
everyone traveling along the[N]
Fairwind Corridor is cutthroat.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Sorry, but I'm curious about[N]
what your underling said, before.[N]
What's the deal with your cargo?[AN]
[L]
If I tell you that, will you tell[N]
me what kind of crew you really run?[AN]
[R]
If you're asking, then I think you[N]
already have a good idea, Calista.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Heh. Yes, I think that I do.[N]
But let's keep it as just an idea.[N]
Otherwise, I'd have to do my job.[AN]
[Beat]I suppose that I can tell you[N]
a bit, since you did save my life.[N]
Our ship has a peculiar mission;[AN]
delivering farming supplies to[N]
a small set of mining islands,[N]
called Rockwell. Do you know of them?[AN]
[R]
Sure, they're close to Port Greagor.[N]
But why send a single navy vessel[N]
instead of a proper convoy?[AN]
[L]
The base that we deployed from thought[N]
that the Fairwind Corridor was a quiet[N]
route, with minimal pirate activity.[AN]
Obviously, they operated with outdated[N]
information[Beat] And my crew paid for it.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Nowhere in the skies is safe,[N]
these days. Best to remember that.[AN]
[L]
Yes[Beat] I suppose that that's true.[N]
Regardless, thanks to your help, we[N]
should be able to continue our mission.[AN]
Although, we'll have to take these[N]
other ships along with us, now[Beat][N]
You don't object to that, do you?[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Well, now. Why would I do that?[N]
I've got enough on my plate already[N]
with a single ship. I don't need more.[AN]
[L]
Ha, is that so? Still, it is a bit[N]
of a shame that you can't take them,[N]
considering your valor today, captain.[AN]
Here. Take this as a consolation prize.[N]
Unfortunately, I can't give any more[N]
than this[Beat] Hopefully, it's enough.[AN]
[R]
Hm[Beat] Well, it's hardly what I'd[N]
get for selling that imperial galleon,[N]
but I'll take any thanks that you offer.[AN]
[L]
Good. Try to keep on the straight[N]
and arrow as best as you can, Lua.[N]
Well, as much as any [OQ]merchant" can.[AN]
[R]
Will do. This [OQ]merchant" will take her[N]
leave once Razvan's done with his work.[N]
Safe travels to you, Calista.[AN]
[L]
To you as well, Lua. Take care![A][X]

a little too soon for you. But me,[N]

[FR][ToggleSmile]
Sorry, sorry. Couldn't resist.[AN]
[L][ToggleSmile]
Regardless, we were fortunate to come[N]
out on top in it. Unfortunate not to[N]
take at least one of those ships with us.[AN]
[R]
Yeah[Beat] Not as big a haul as I'd like.[N]
But the only way we were getting those[N]
ships was wiping out the other marines.[AN]
[FL]
And I'm quite glad that you decided[N]
not to do that, captain. But why?[AN]
I thought you held quite the grudge[N]
towards the marines. It seemed[Beat][N]
Well, more merciful than I'd expect.[AN]
[R]
Beyond the obvious of not wanting[N]
to tangle with Incendivis soldiers?[N]
Well[Beat] They weren't ordinary marines.[AN]
I mean, most of them were barely[N]
trained, and their goal was to support[N]
citzens with those farming supplies.[AN]
Sure, I'm a pirate[Beat] But I'm not[N]
going to steal from regular people,[N]
just trying to get by. It's not right.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]A noble thought, Lua. But if they[N]
couldn't be bothered to send more than[N]
one ship, I doubt that it's a trend.[AN]
[FR]
Mm. Maybe, maybe not. But it's good[N]
seein' it, anyway. I don't have much[N]
hope for the empire turnin' it around,[AN]
but maybe if this mission goes well,[N]
we'll see more ones like it, eh?[AN]

Overly optimistic, as usual.[N]
You must have both eyes closed,[N]

And you've got both ears shut![N]

H-Hey! Miss Pilar, Desiderio, can't you[N]
two settle down? We just won a battle[Beat][N]
Do you really need to fight again, here?[A]
[L]
[Beat]He makes a good point, Desiderio.[N]
[FR]
That he does. Alright! We'll can it[N]
til later, when we're on solid ground.[N]
But for now[Beat] how about we play cards?[AN]
[L][ToggleSmile]
Well, if you want to lose gold so badly,[N]
then be my guest. Lua, care to join?[AN]
[R]
Oh, I wouldn't miss any chance[N]
to send Desiderio into debt.[AN]
[FR]
Uh[Beat] Hold on. Maybe we can wait-[AN]
[FL]
Didn't you always tell me that[N]
a man never goes back on his word?[N]
You can't back down now, Desiderio![AN]
