Ch A-6: Race Against Time[X]

## ChA6GoalWindow
Rout[X]

## ChA6StatusObjective
Defeat all enemies,[N]
and disarm all bombs.[X]

## ChA6Pre1
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier][MR][LoadSantiago]
[FL]
This is incredible[Beat][AN]
At last, we have the power to[N]
strike back at the empire![AN]
This looks like enough to level[N]
the imperial palace![AN][X]

## ChA6Pre2
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier][MR][LoadSantiago]
[FL]
[3LB][L]
Don't be ridiculous, we'd never[N]
get close enough. They'd blast us[N]
out of the sky.[AN]
How about Delgado Harbor?[N]
It'd be easy to slip in and out[N]
unsuspected.[AN]
[MR]
No, that won't do. Too many innocents[N]
would be harmed in the process.[AN]
We want to hit the imperial dogs, not[N]
those suffering under their tyranny.[AN]
We've got enough for two targets,[N]
so we'll attack the marine barracks[N]
and the imperial smithy.[AN]
Anyone fool enough to serve the[N]
Imperial Marines deserves what's coming.[AN]
[L]
Right as ever, boss.[N]
Heh, I can't wait to stick it[N]
to those imperial bastards.[AN]
[L][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadSlicer][L][LoadDicer]
[FL]
Bad news, Santiago. There's an[N]
incoming ship, and its crew[N]
looks ready for a fight.[AN]
[R]
Just my luck[Beat][N]
How the hell did this happen?[AN]
You didn't blab about this, did you?[N]
To anyone other than me, that is.[AN]
[2LB][L]
No way! You gave us a better deal[N]
than we could've dreamt of.[AN]
Wasn't much point looking for other[N]
buyers after an offer like yours.[AN]
[FL]
It must be that idiot merchant who[N]
hired us to move the goods.[AN]
Didn't think he had it in him to[N]
pick a fight with us over this.[AN]
[MR]
Well, either way, it looks like[N]
we've got a fight on our hands.[AN]
We rebels have trained for this[Beat][N]
You won't find us wanting, today.[AN]
Will your men also hold their own?[AN]
[L]
Heh, you bet! C'mon, boys! Let's[N]
welcome our uninvited guests![AN]
[L][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier]
[3LB][MR]
My comrades, this is a fight we must win.[N]
But if we should fall, we cannot allow[N]
the enemy to learn of our plans.[AN]
Quickly, set up explosives around the[N]
cave. If we win this battle, we'll[N]
disarm them afterwards, but if not[Beat][AN]
The cause is greater than any one of us.[N]
If the worst comes to pass, we'll bury[N]
the enemy in here with us.[AN]
[1LB][FL]
Yes, sir![AN]
[L]
We're with you to the end![AN]
[MR]
Good, let's give them hell![AN][X]

## ChA6Pre3
[R][LoadLua][FR][LoadRochefort]
[R]
Come on out! We're here for the[N]
spice shipment you stole![AN][X]

## ChA6Pre4
[R][LoadLua][FR][LoadRochefort]
[FL][LoadSlicer][L][LoadDicer]
[1LB][FL]
Spice shipment?[AN]
[1LB][L]
The hell are you talking about?[AN]
[3LB][R]
Playing dumb won't help.[N]
Now hand it over, and[N]
no one has to get hurt.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
We've stolen a lot of stuff,[N]
but spices ain't one of them.[AN]
[1LB][L]
Always preferred my food mild myself.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
That's not what[Beat] Ah, forget it.[N]
You want a fight? You've got one![AN]
[L]
Wait, isn't that the guy who[N]
hired us to transport the-[AN]
[FR]
Captain Lua, I'm afraid we've no[N]
choice but to battle it out.[AN]
[3LB][R]
What the hell is going on? Rochefort,[N]
if there's something you're keeping[N]
from me, now's the time to explain.[AN]
[FR]
I've been nothing but forthright with[N]
you. What are you waiting for?[N]
I didn't hire you to chat![AN]
[FR][ClearFace]
[2LB][R]
This whole situation reeks. Desiderio,[N]
lift the anchor. We're turning around![AN]
[FFR]
No can do, captain.[N]
They've already got us grappled![AN]
[3LB][FL]
You think we'll let you go so easily?[N]
You've got a mighty fine ship![N]
I think we'll add it to our collection![AN]
[R][MoveFarRight]
[3LB][R][LoadSuzanne]
Finally, some action. Come on,[N]
meathead! Your face'll look so[N]
much better filled with lead![AN]
[2LB][L]
Bring it on, girl![N]
I've been itching for a good fight.[AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[3LB][R][LoadMatteo]
Don't get started without me![AN]
You don't look like much, pal.[N]
Think you can keep up with[N]
a swordsman of my caliber?[AN]
[2LB][FL][MoveLeft]
Is that a challenge? Lucky for you, you[N]
won't live long enough to regret it![AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[FR]
[Beat]If there's no way back, then there's[N]
only one way through. Looks like we're[N]
going with Plan A, everyone! To arms![A][X]

## ChA6BombWarning
[3LB][L][LoadLua]
Is that sulfur I smell?[AN]
What the[Beat] Everyone, be careful![N]
This cave is rigged with explosives![N]
Cut their fuses before it's too late.[AN][X]

## ChA6BombInfoBox
Bombs can be disarmed by attacking[N]
them with a sword, lance, axe, or[N]
knife at 1 range.[A][X]

## ChA6BombExplodes
[L][LoadLua]
No, we're too late![N]
The cave is collapsing![AN]
[X]

## ChA6End1
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRochefort]
[ML][3LB]
That's all the bombs defused[Beat][N]
Alright, Rochefort. You've got[N]
a lot of explaining to do.[AN]
[MR]
I swear, I didn't expect this to happen![N]
I had absolutely no idea that these[N]
pirates were cooperating with rebels![AN]
[ML]
Really? Let me ask a different question.[N]
Where are these so-called [OQ]spices"?[N]
All I see is gunpowder and nitroglycerin.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
They[Beat] They must have sold them already![N]
Yes, I've never seen these crates before![AN]
[ML][3LB]
Who do you think you're fooling?[N]
It's clear as day that these explosives[N]
were the goods that you wanted to recover.[AN]
Now it makes sense why you would pay[N]
so much gold to have them returned[Beat][N]
You'd make a killing off smuggling them.[AN]
[MR]
Hmph! Suppose that you speak true.[N]
You took this job for the money,[N]
so what's it matter to you?[AN]
You're a pirate! Who are you to[N]
judge how others make their coin?[AN]
[ML]
I couldn't care less about that.[N]
No, I care about how these'll be used.[AN]
If you're transporting it illicitly,[N]
then there's no doubt that your buyers[N]
won't be using it for anything good.[AN]
I'd be enabling that, working with you.[N]
There are some lines that I won't cross.[N]
The deal's off, everyone. Seize him![AN]
[MR][MoveFarRight][R][LoadMatteo]
[R]
Not so fast! Rochefort may be a snake,[N]
but I still work for him. I won't[N]
hand him over to you without a fight.[AN]
[FR][ClearFace][FR][LoadSuzanne]
They're not bad, but I bet we can[N]
take 'em. Take one step closer,[N]
and it'll be your funeral![AN]
[2LB][R]
So what'll it be? You can have your[N]
gold, and we'll be on our way.[AN]
Or would you prefer to test[N]
your blade against mine?[AN]
[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadDesiderio]
[3LB][L]
Boss, let me handle this.[N]
You two, what's your price?[AN]
Whatever you're bein' paid,[N]
I'm sure we can match it.[N]
Come work for us instead.[AN]
[R]
You want us to join your crew?[N]
We may be sellswords, but[N]
piracy is a bit of a jump.[AN]
You don't seem so bad, but I'm not[N]
sure a life of crime suits me.[AN]
[FL]
A bit late for that, don't you think?[N]
Last I checked, smugging explosives[N]
isn't sanctioned by Incendivis law.[AN]
[2LB][FR]
She's got us there, Matteo. Besides,[N]
I think I'd make a pretty great pirate.[AN]
As long as there's good pay and good[N]
fights, I could get used to it.[AN]
[R]
Alright, then. How about this?[N]
5,000 gold up front, plus a fair wage.[AN]
[FR]
Each. Mercenaries of our caliber[N]
don't work for cheap, got it?[AN]
[3LB][FL]
Fine, but for that much money,[N]
you'd better pull your weight.[AN]
Go ahead and take your gold from[N]
your former employer. I made sure he[N]
had our fee ready when we set sail.[AN]
[2LB][FR]
Aye aye, captain! Heh, I'm feeling[N]
like a pirate already![AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[1LB][FFR]
Hey, what are you doing? Unhand me![AN]
[R][LoadRazvan]
[3LB][R]
Captain, what should we do with[N]
all of these explosives?[N]
We can't just leave them here.[AN]
[FL]
Hm[Beat] There are a few explosives[N]
that we can use for ourselves,[N]
but let's dump the rest of the stuff.[AN]
We don't have a proper gunsmith[N]
to take advantage of them,[N]
so they'd just waste cargo space.[AN]
[L]
Eh[Beat]  We'd make a lotta money sellin'[N]
the stuff, but it's your call, boss.[AN]
Dumpin' all of it to the Lands Below[N]
means we aren't gettin' much for this[N]
job. We really got taken for a ride, huh?[AN]
[R]
Perhaps. But we did defeat a notorious[N]
rebel, at least. The man in the back,[N]
Santiago[Beat] He's famously radical.[AN]
Even among rebels and their ilk,[N]
he's dangerous. Who knows what plans[N]
he had for all of these explosives?[AN]
[FR][LoadPilar]
[Beat]I offered some of his men a chance[N]
to surrender, in exchange for knowledge[N]
about his plans. Not one of them folded.[AN]
They resolved to take their secret plans[N]
to the grave[Beat] Admirable, if futile.[N]
They stood no chance, to begin with.[AN]
[L][1LB]
Hm? Whaddaya mean by that, Pilar?[AN]
[FR][3LB]
An operation of this size means nothing.[N]
Incendivis's forces dwarf this group[N]
of rebels by an unimaginable magnitude.[AN]
Whatever strike Santiago had planned[Beat][N]
It would hurt the empire no more than[N]
a mosquito's needle penetrates flesh.[AN]
Perhaps if these thousands of mosquitoes[N]
struck at once, something could change.[AN]
But whether from pride, stupidity, or[N]
envy, rebel cells mostly operate alone.[N]
Thus, the mosquitoes move to pierce[Beat][AN]
And then, they bleed out just as quickly.[N]
A waste of life, and a waste of time.[AN]
[L]
Hey, I'm with you on that one.[N]
Better to take things easy, like us,[N]
than get all worked up over a cause.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]You almost speak wistfully,[N]
Miss Pilar. is this[Beat] something[N]
that you've experienced, yourself?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]That's a story for another time.[N]
Perhaps when you can drink, Razvan.[N]
But for now[Beat] Your orders, Lua?[AN]
[FL]
Well, it's been a long, long day[Beat][N]
Let's salvage whatever we can here[N]
and head back to Port Greagor.[A][X]
