units to clear this chapter.[AN]
As a side-objective, try to Drop[N]

If all of them are escorted there,[N]
then you will get a reward at the end.[N]
Enemies will not attack the logs.[A][X]

Still nothing?[A][X]

[Beat]Nothing happened,[N]

I can hear the river.[N]
[Beat]We're getting close.[N]
Keep up the pace.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadBiko]
[Left]
Tell that to your brother.[N]
This young man looks like[N]
he's about to keel over.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[CloseEyes]Grooooaaagghhh[Beat][N]
Ondeh[Beat] I need to take a break.[N]
[OpenEyes]My legs're almost jelly[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Once we get the treasure, you[N]
can have all of the fruit preserves[N]
you want. I'll buy you your favorite.[AN]
[Left]
Doesn't sound like a bad deal, kid.[N]
My crew is right behind.[N]
Let's not waste time.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Don't listen to her honeyed words,[N]
Captain[Beat] She'll just work you[N]
harder like she always does.[AN]
[MidRight]
You need to work to make it in this world.[N]
Not everyone has an older sister to[N]
spoonfeed them boysenberry jam.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Boysenberry[Beat] Dang it, Biko.[N]
Fine, fine, let's keep moving.[N]
A proper rest can wait.[AN]
[Left]
Glad you two could work out a deal.[N]
I know a merchant who knows a purveyor[N]
of fine jams, jellies, and preserves.[AN]
If this job goes well, maybe I can set[N]
up an introduction. No doubt they'd[N]
appreciate a new, loyal client.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[2LB]
Purveyor of jams?[N]
Like those artisanal ones?[AN]
[Left]
Fine fruits, rare fruits.[N]
Expert craftsmanship, I'd add.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You know, I'm suddenly feeling[N]
a lot better about all this.[AN]
Ondeh, Miss Lua, you both should[N]
follow me. Here we go![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[3LB]
Purveyor of fine jams?[N]
I've never heard of such an occupation.[N]
But thank you for giving him a nudge.[AN]
You picked up what I was going for quickly.[N]
The only thing that stops him from loafing[N]
is offering him dessert, I'm afraid.[AN]
[Left]
I made it up.[N]
I don't want to waste time[N]
in this jungle either.[AN]

So, this is the tomb[N]
of San Torino.[AN]
For all of the bluster about[N]
it being so well-hidden,[AN]
I'm surprised we found it[N]
without much trouble.[AN]
[FarRight]
And San Torino was nice enough[N]
to leave the door open for us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[3LB]
Don't let an inviting entrance[N]
let your guard down. Consider this:[AN]
Finding your way here may be simple,[N]
but getting back's the hard part.[AN]
Places found by the dead are usually[N]
those that are hidden to the living.[N]
Take caution, kids[Beat] Let's go.[A][X]

This is it? It's so small.[AN]
I thought you said she was[N]
some sort of king buried[N]
with a litter of cats.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
So the legend goes at least.[N]
It's probably embellished.[AN]
[Right]
There's a plaque. It looks[N]
a bit worn[Beat][AN]
[OpenQuote]Here lies San Torino,[N]
the woman king of Pellegrino.[AN]
Her treasures scattered in the jungle,[N]
the truth revealed only by wooden key.[CloseQuote][AN]
[MidLeft]
So this is just an altar.[N]

Slippery wench[Beat] We almost lost her.[N]
But she ain't all that.[AN]

Gugh! It's that danged Sagargala![AN]
[Right]
The Rioja Reapers[Beat] They followed us.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Hm[Beat] I've dealt with them before.[AN]
They don't do much besides small-time[N]
theft and exploiting people's debts[Beat][N]
You'd better explain this, Ondeh. Fast.[A]
[Right]
We're not setting you up[Beat][N]
I swear it on my mother's grave![N]
The truth is, we owe these men a debt.[AN]
The rumored treasure that lies here[Beat][N]
If I could get even a fraction of its[N]
value, I could pay them off[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
But it looks like these lowlives have[N]
another idea: selling you both off.[AN]
[FR]
Ouuugh[Beat] I'm feeling queasy, Ondeh.[N]
I've only ever fought straw dummies[Beat][AN]
[R]
Stand behind me, Biko! I'll do what[N]
I can, but the odds look grim[Beat][N]
Captain Lua, I hate to ask, but-[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Ease up, girl. I wasn't going to turn[N]
over two kids to a bunch of loan sharks.[AN]
Consider yourselves temporary crew until[N]
we clear this forest. Get ready, you two;[N]
our only way out of here is through![AN][X]

[FR]
Oh no, I don't think San Torino[N]
likes us fighting out here[Beat][AN]

Then we'd better keep moving then.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Last thing we need is a damned specter[N]
appearing and haunting us all.[AN][X]

So it was all a sham.[N]
They led us here to kill us.[AN]
Goaded us to step to our deaths.[N]
Captain Lua, if not for you[Beat][AN]
We would both be dead.[N]
For that, I'm grateful.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Don't bend your knee, Ondeh.[N]
It's that attitude[N]
that got you in trouble.[AN]
At the very least,[N]
I know you didn't set us up,[N]
so consider yourselves spared.[AN]
However, debt doesn't get washed[N]
away with a man's death.[AN]
Whatever you owe is now[N]
owed to me instead.[AN]
[Right][2LB]
[Beat] Very well.[N]
It's an amount of-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Peace. Let's say this.[N]
I consider your debt canceled.[AN]
You owe me nothing more.[N]
You're free to do as you please.[AN]
[FarRight]
Y-you're being for real, Captain?[N]
Thank you! This is great![AN]
[Right]
Quiet, Biko.[AN]
Captain Lua[Beat][N]
I appreciate your kindness.[AN]
[MidLeft]
However, I would instead[N]
offer you both employment.[AN]
You each proved your worth today,[N]
and I know you'll be good for our crew.[AN]
We can arrange a proper contract.[N]
What do you both say?[AN]
[FarRight]
I think we should do it, Ondeh.[N]
Captain Lua seems like a nice person.[AN]
[Right]
It's true. She could've left us for dead[N]
and turned us over to the Reapers.[AN]
Instead, she chose to save us[Beat][N]
Captain Lua[Beat] I accept.[AN]
I will serve your crew honorably.[N]
I trust you'll find use for us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Excellent. Welcome aboard.[N]
Now then, let's head back to port.[A][X]

## A3_Ending_BikoAlive
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidRight][LoadBiko][3LB]
So they[Beat] they tricked us,[N]
from the start. There was[N]
no treasure. No reason to come.[AN]
And now, Ondeh's[Beat] Ondeh's[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'm sorry for your loss, Biko.[N]
My crew did the best that we could,[N]
but there were just too many of them.[AN]
[MR]
I don't blame you, captain. If you[N]
guys hadn't come with us, then[Beat][N]
Then I'd be lying on the ground, too.[AN]
Man[Beat] this is all my fault, huh?[N]
Ondeh was always pushing herself hard,[N]
trying to make things easier for us.[AN]
And I just lazed around[Beat] ate my jams[Beat][N]
If I'd been a better brother, then maybe[N]
we'd never have gone into debt. Maybe-[AN]
[ML]
Once you go down that road, Biko,[N]
it never ends. You shouldn't think[N]
about what might've been. Only what is.[AN]
As for that debt, a dead man's debt[N]
transfers to his killer, generally.[N]
That means me, the captain of this crew[Beat][AN]
But there's no way that I'd hold[N]
a debt over a kid just trying[N]
to get by[Beat] Especially not now.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, captain. I[Beat] I don't know[N]
what to do, though. Ondeh handled[N]
everything, and now, she's gone.[AN]
I'm alone[Beat] And I've got nothing[N]
to my name besides a decent speararm.[N]
Too old to go to an orphanage, too.[AN]
[ML]
If you've got no place else to go,[N]
then you can join my crew, Biko.[N]
That spear arm's better than you think.[AN]
We'd be lucky to count you as one[N]
of us. Say the word, and I'll ready[N]
a contract once we're out of here.[AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] If you'll have me, then I'm in.[N]
You saved my life, wiped our debt[Beat][N]
I'll make it up to you, one day.[AN]
[ML]
Don't worry about making it up, Biko.[AN]
Starting today, you're a pirate.[N]
And a pirate owes nobody anything,[N]
except his crew. Understand?[AN]
[MR]
Y-Yes! I understand, captain![AN]
[Beat]One more thing. Can we[Beat] Can we[N]
bring Ondeh with us, for a burial?[N]
I don't have the money for it, but-[AN]
[ML]
I'll cover it. As far as I'm concerned,[N]
Ondeh was crew, too. And a captain[N]
always honors her fallen crewmates.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Thanks, captain. Seriously.[N]
I can't thank you enough.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You're welcome, Biko. Now,[N]
let's get back to port and get[N]
Ondeh the rest that she deserves[Beat][AN][X]

## A3_Ending_OndehAlive

[MidRight][LoadOndeh][3LB]
So it was all a sham.[N]
They led us here to kill us.[N]
Goaded us to step to our deaths.[AN]
And I[Beat] I couldn't see it![N]
I led Biko into this death trap[Beat][N]
And now, he's[Beat] he's really[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'm sorry for your loss, Ondeh.[N]
My crew did the best that we could,[N]
but there were just too many of them.[AN]
[MR]
I know. I know. If not for you,[N]
then I would be dead too, captain.[N]
It's just[Beat] What do I do, now?[AN]
I could only keep going, despite[N]
our debt, because Biko was there.[N]
He needed me. And I[Beat] I needed him.[AN]
But now, I still have the debt, and-[A]
[ML]
A debt to a dead man means nothing,[N]
Ondeh. Normally, this kind of debt[N]
would be owed to his killer. Me.[AN]
But there's no way that I'd hold[N]
a debt over a girl just trying[N]
to get by[Beat] Especially not now.[AN]
[MR]
That's[Beat] Thank you, captain.[N]
I[Beat] I don't know what to say.[N]
Or what to do, going forward.[AN]
[ML]
If you've got no place else to go,[N]
then you can join my crew, Ondeh.[N]
You're a good shot. A diligent girl.[AN]
We'd be lucky to count you as one[N]
of us. Say the word, and I'll ready[N]
a contract once we're out of here.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I accept, captain. I'll join.[N]
You saved my life, wiped our debt[Beat][N]
It's the least that I could do.[AN]
[ML]
Look, Ondeh[Beat] Enough about debts.[N]
Starting today, you don't owe[N]
anyone anything, except yourself.[AN]
You'll need to live enough for[N]
Biko now, too. Isn't that right?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Mm. Then I won't speak of debts.[N]
I'll work hard to earn my fair share[N]
of the loot[Beat] I'll save up my gold.[AN]
So[Beat] can we bring Biko and have him[N]
buried? I'll pay you back for the costs-[AN]
[ML]
No, I'll pay. As far as I'm concerned,[N]
that boy was crew, too. And a captain[N]
always honors her fallen crewmates.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]
[Beat]Thank you so much, Captain Lua.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You're welcome, Ondeh. Now,[N]
let's get back to port and get[N]
Biko the rest that he deserves[Beat][AN][X]

## A3_Ending_AllDead
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Those bastards planned this[N]
from the start. They tricked[N]
Biko and Ondeh, all to kill them.[AN]
And they got exactly what they[N]
wanted[Beat] Hell, what was the point?[N]
What was the point of any of this?[AN]
All I did was watch as two kids[N]
got themselves killed, chasing[N]
some fool legend[Beat] What a joke.[AN]
[MR][LoadPilar]
[Beat]Lua. You can't sit here[N]
and grieve forever. That[Beat][N]
That thing may still be after us.[AN]
[ML]
I know. I'll be on my way soon.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. Don't take long.[A][CSSCF]
[ML]
[Beat]Biko. Ondeh. I won't forget you,[N]
no matter how little time we shared.[AN]
And if the Maker truly does exist[Beat][N]
I hope that he's laid you to rest.[N]
That you're finally free, at last.[A][X]

## A3_ForestFriendText
[ML][LoadForestProtector][3LB]
Mm[Beat] You have passed my trial,[N]
young ones. Excellently done.[AN]
For your valor in returning my[N]

Here. A fraction of my power.[AN]
May it serve you well,[N]
in the battles to come[Beat][A][X]

## A3_SagargalaDeadAftermath
[MidRight][LoadLua]
That slaver's dead? Good riddance.[N]
Without their leader, there won't[N]
be any organized pursuit, I'd bet[Beat][AN]
Let's get the hell out of here[N]
before that spirit catches up![A][X]
