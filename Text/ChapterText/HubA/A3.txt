Keep up the pace.[AN]

Tell that to your brother.[N]
This young man looks like[N]
he's about to keel over.[AN]

[CloseEyes]Grooooaaagghhh[Beat][N]
Ondeh[Beat] I need to take a break.[N]
[OpenEyes]My legs're almost jelly[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Once we get the treasure, you[N]
can have all of the fruit preserves[N]
you want. I'll buy you your favorite.[AN]
[Left]
Doesn't sound like a bad deal, kid.[N]
My crew is right behind.[N]
Let's not waste time.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Don't listen to her honeyed words,[N]
Captain[Beat] She'll just work you[N]
harder like she always does.[AN]
[MidRight]
You need to work to make it in this world.[N]
Not everyone has an older sister to[N]
spoonfeed them boysenberry jam.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Boysenberry[Beat] Dang it, Biko.[N]
Fine, fine, let's keep moving.[N]
A proper rest can wait.[AN]
[Left]
Glad you two could work out a deal.[N]
I know a merchant who knows a purveyor[N]
of fine jams, jellies, and preserves.[AN]
If this job goes well, maybe I can set[N]
up an introduction. No doubt they'd[N]
appreciate a new, loyal client.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[2LB]
Purveyor of jams?[N]
Like those artisanal ones?[AN]
[Left]
Fine fruits, rare fruits.[N]
Expert craftsmanship, I'd add.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You know, I'm suddenly feeling[N]
a lot better about all this.[AN]
Ondeh, Miss Lua, you both should[N]
follow me. Here we go![AN]

[3LB]
Purveyor of fine jams?[N]
I've never heard of such an occupation.[N]
But thank you for giving him a nudge.[AN]
You picked up what I was going for quickly.[N]
The only thing that stops him from loafing[N]
is offering him dessert, I'm afraid.[AN]

I made it up.[N]
I don't want to waste time[N]
in this jungle either.[AN]

So, this is the tomb[N]
of San Torino.[AN]
For all of the bluster about[N]
it being so well-hidden,[AN]
I'm surprised we found it[N]
without much trouble.[AN]
[FarRight]
And San Torino was nice enough[N]
to leave the door open for us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[3LB]
Don't let an inviting entrance[N]
let your guard down. Consider this:[AN]
Finding your way here may be simple,[N]
but getting back's the hard part.[AN]
Places found by the dead are usually[N]
those that are hidden to the living.[N]

This is it? It's so small.[AN]
I thought you said she was[N]
some sort of king buried[N]
with a litter of cats.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
So the legend goes at least.[N]
It's probably embellished.[AN]
[Right]
There's a plaque. It looks[N]
a bit worn[Beat][AN]
[OpenQuote]Here lies San Torino,[N]
the woman king of Pellegrino.[AN]
Her treasures scattered in the jungle,[N]
the truth revealed only by wooden key.[CloseQuote][AN]

Gugh! It's that danged Sagargala![AN]

The Rioja Reapers[Beat] They followed us.[AN]

This smells like a set-up to me.[N]
You have five seconds to convince[N]
me otherwise. Talk. Now.[AN]
[Right]
We're not setting you up[Beat][N]
I swear it on my mother's grave.[N]
We owe these men a debt.[AN]
I heard rumors of a treasure.[N]

sorry lot as well?[AN]

Milking me for coin may have[N]

Brat with a spear, eh?[AN]
You should be pointing[AN]
it at your sister.[AN]
She got you in this mess, kid.[AN]

No[Beat] Ondeh was deceived.[N]
We shouldn't have trusted you.[AN]
I will never betray my sister![A][X]

## A3_BossQuote_Ondeh
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Thanks for leading us here,[N]
wench. Your debt's repaid.[AN]
Just hand over the treasure.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadOndeh]
If that's all it took, why take[N]
an army to track us down?[AN]
Surely you didn't come here[N]
to negotiate.[AN]
I know better than to trust[N]
your kind now.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Strong words from a doxy.[AN]
Back in my day,[N]
they didn't talk back.[AN]
Looks like I'll need to put[N]
you in your place.[AN]
A shame[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadOndeh]
I worked hard to[N]
pay off my debt.[AN]
You terrorized us[N]
at every turn anyway.[AN]
No matter what we offered,[N]
you still wanted more[Beat][AN]
I see now you never intended[N]
to spare us, even after this.[AN]
I've learned a[N]
difficult lesson[Beat][AN]

that mistake again.[A][X]

## A3_BossQuote_Lua

Ah, Captain Lua![AN]
Sorry I didn't[N]

I don't have any groveling[N]
men on the shelf today.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
I think I'm piecing[N]
this together.[AN]
You tricked that girl,[N]
didn't you?[AN]
Offered her a debt she could[N]
never repay, is that right?[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
For someone who rubs elbows[N]
with sorry men and naive girls,[AN]
your eye is more keen[N]
than I'd come to expect.[AN]
You'd do well in the Reapers,[N]
reporting to me, of course.[AN]
It is a shame we crossed[N]
paths like this.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Keep dreaming.[N]
I work for myself now.[AN]
And I'd certainly never[N]
bend the knee to a dastard.[AN]
Selling men and terrorizing[N]
women is the stuff of cowards.[AN]
To sink so low would fill[N]
with me unimaginable shame[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Keep squawking about morals.[N]
I'm not here for a lecture.[AN]
Raise your blade, wench.[N]

Losing to women and babes[Beat][N]

[FarRight][LoadBiko]
[Right][LoadOndeh]
So it was all a sham.[N]
They led us here to kill us.[AN]
Goaded us to step to our deaths.[N]
Captain Lua, if not for you[Beat][AN]
We would both be dead.[N]
For that, I'm grateful.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Don't bend your knee, Ondeh.[N]
It's that attitude[N]
that got you in trouble.[AN]
At the very least,[N]
I know you didn't set us up,[N]
so consider yourselves spared.[AN]
However, debt doesn't get washed[N]
away with a man's death.[AN]
Whatever you owe is now[N]
owed to me instead.[AN]
[Right][2LB]
[Beat] Very well.[N]
It's an amount of-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Peace. Let's say this.[N]
I consider your debt canceled.[AN]
You owe me nothing more.[N]
You're free to do as you please.[AN]
[FarRight]
Y-you're being for real, Captain?[N]
Thank you! This is great![AN]
[Right]
Quiet, Biko.[AN]
Captain Lua[Beat][N]
I appreciate your kindness.[AN]
[MidLeft]
However, I would instead[N]
offer you both employment.[AN]
You each proved your worth today,[N]
and I know you'll be good for our crew.[AN]
We can arrange a proper contract.[N]
What do you both say?[AN]
[FarRight]
I think we should do it, Ondeh.[N]
Captain Lua seems like a nice person.[AN]
[Right]
It's true. She could've left us for dead[N]
and turned us over to the Reapers.[AN]
Instead, she chose to save us[Beat][N]
Captain Lua[Beat] I accept.[AN]
I will serve your crew honorably.[N]
I trust you'll find use for us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Excellent. Welcome aboard.[N]
Now then, let's head back to port.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadBiko][3LB]
So they[Beat] they tricked us,[N]
from the start. There was[N]
no treasure. No reason to come.[AN]
And now, Ondeh's[Beat] Ondeh's[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'm sorry for your loss, Biko.[N]
My crew did the best that we could,[N]
but there were just too many of them.[AN]
[MR]
I don't blame you, captain. If you[N]
guys hadn't come with us, then[Beat][N]
Then I'd be lying on the ground, too.[AN]
Man[Beat] this is all my fault, huh?[N]
Ondeh was always pushing herself hard,[N]
trying to make things easier for us.[AN]
And I just lazed around[Beat] ate my jams[Beat][N]
If I'd been a better brother, then maybe[N]
we'd never have gone into debt. Maybe-[AN]
[ML]
Once you go down that road, Biko,[N]
it never ends. You shouldn't think[N]
about what might've been. Only what is.[AN]
As for that debt, a dead man's debt[N]
transfers to his killer, generally.[N]
That means me, the captain of this crew[Beat][AN]
But there's no way that I'd hold[N]
a debt over a kid just trying[N]
to get by[Beat] Especially not now.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, captain. I[Beat] I don't know[N]
what to do, though. Ondeh handled[N]
everything, and now, she's gone.[AN]
I'm alone[Beat] And I've got nothing[N]
to my name besides a decent speararm.[N]
Too old to go to an orphanage, too.[AN]
[ML]
If you've got no place else to go,[N]
then you can join my crew, Biko.[N]
That spear arm's better than you think.[AN]
We'd be lucky to count you as one[N]
of us. Say the word, and I'll ready[N]
a contract once we're out of here.[AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] If you'll have me, then I'm in.[N]
You saved my life, wiped our debt[Beat][N]
I'll make it up to you, one day.[AN]
[ML]
Don't worry about making it up, Biko.[AN]
Starting today, you're a pirate.[N]
And a pirate owes nobody anything,[N]
except his crew. Understand?[AN]
[MR]
Y-Yes! I understand, captain![AN]
[Beat]One more thing. Can we[Beat] Can we[N]
bring Ondeh with us, for a burial?[N]
I don't have the money for it, but-[AN]
[ML]
I'll cover it. As far as I'm concerned,[N]
Ondeh was crew, too. And a captain[N]
always honors her fallen crewmates.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Thanks, captain. Seriously.[N]
I can't thank you enough.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You're welcome, Biko. Now,[N]
let's get back to port and get[N]
Ondeh the rest that she deserves[Beat][AN][X]

So it was all a sham.[N]
They led us here to kill us.[N]
Goaded us to step to our deaths.[AN]
And I[Beat] I couldn't see it![N]
I led Biko into this death trap[Beat][N]
And now, he's[Beat] he's really[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'm sorry for your loss, Ondeh.[N]
My crew did the best that we could,[N]
but there were just too many of them.[AN]
[MR]
I know. I know. If not for you,[N]
then I would be dead too, captain.[N]
It's just[Beat] What do I do, now?[AN]
I could only keep going, despite[N]
our debt, because Biko was there.[N]
He needed me. And I[Beat] I needed him.[AN]
But now, I still have the debt, and-[A]
[ML]
A debt to a dead man means nothing,[N]
Ondeh. Normally, this kind of debt[N]
would be owed to his killer. Me.[AN]
But there's no way that I'd hold[N]
a debt over a girl just trying[N]
to get by[Beat] Especially not now.[AN]
[MR]
That's[Beat] Thank you, captain.[N]
I[Beat] I don't know what to say.[N]
Or what to do, going forward.[AN]
[ML]
If you've got no place else to go,[N]
then you can join my crew, Ondeh.[N]
You're a good shot. A diligent girl.[AN]
We'd be lucky to count you as one[N]
of us. Say the word, and I'll ready[N]
a contract once we're out of here.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I accept, captain. I'll join.[N]
You saved my life, wiped our debt[Beat][N]
It's the least that I could do.[AN]
[ML]
Look, Ondeh[Beat] Enough about debts.[N]
Starting today, you don't owe[N]
anyone anything, except yourself.[AN]
You'll need to live enough for[N]
Biko now, too. Isn't that right?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Mm. Then I won't speak of debts.[N]
I'll work hard to earn my fair share[N]
of the loot[Beat] I'll save up my gold.[AN]
So[Beat] can we bring Biko and have him[N]
buried? I'll pay you back for the costs-[AN]
[ML]
No, I'll pay. As far as I'm concerned,[N]
that boy was crew, too. And a captain[N]
always honors her fallen crewmates.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]
[Beat]Thank you so much, Captain Lua.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You're welcome, Ondeh. Now,[N]
let's get back to port and get[N]

[Beat]Those bastards planned this[N]
from the start. They tricked[N]
Biko and Ondeh, all to kill them.[AN]
And they got exactly what they[N]
wanted[Beat] Hell, what was the point?[N]
What was the point of any of this?[AN]
All I did was watch as two kids[N]
got themselves killed, chasing[N]
some fool legend[Beat] What a joke.[AN]
