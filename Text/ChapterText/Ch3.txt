[ML]
Lua. How goes the planning?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
As well as it can, I guess.[AN]
The crew's grown fairly large,[N]
so there's a lot more paperwork[N]
to deal with and loot to dole out.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] My condolences. Anyway,[N]
I came here to give you a report.[N]
So far, the journey's been smooth.[AN]
But the weather indicates a storm[N]
is coming for us within the hour.[AN]
Our ships are well-equipped for it,[N]
thanks to Rahel and her carpentry,[N]
but we still need to be vigilant.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, Pilar. Hm[Beat] I should've[N]
known that flying to the Old[N]
World wouldn't be easy, but still[Beat][AN]
[ML]
You should have, yes. The Old World[N]
is largely unknown for a reason:[N]
the numerous storms circling it.[AN]
Truthfully, the one coming toward[N]
us appears relatively mild for the[N]
region. Certainly not a tempest.[AN]
[MR]
Then I guess I can't complain, huh?[N]
We can handle it. If we couldn't,[N]
then you'd have warned us off, right?[AN]
[ML]
Of course. The problem lies in what[N]
comes after we make it through, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll see soon enough.[AN][X]

[FarRight][LoadLua]
[L]
C-Captain Lua, there's big trouble![N]
We have to get out of here, now![AN]
[FR]
Calm down, Rahel.[N]
What's the situation?[AN]
[FL]
Just a few friends behind us, is all.[N]
Ones bearing TORCH flags and grim faces.[AN]
[FR]
How few is few, exactly?[AN]
[L][3LB]
There was one really big ship,[N]
and about four smaller ones.[N]
They definitely outnumber us.[AN]
[FL]
I hoped that all of our misadventures[N]
in the outskirts threw TORCH off our tail,[N]
but it seems that was wishful thinking.[AN]
[FR]
Maybe. Either way, they've outnumbered[N]
us before, and we came out on top.[N]
Today won't be any different.[AN]
That said, we're not on our own turf,[N]
so we won't have the advantage here.[AN]
[FL]
Continuing to flee is still an option,[N]
one that I would personally recommend.[N]
I am a merchant at heart, not a fighter.[AN]
[R]
Yes, that much is clear. Think, Orlando.[N]
Turning our backs to them would only[N]
allow them to hunt us down freely.[AN]
[FL]
Yes, and turning our fronts to them[N]
would only allow them to run us through[N]
with impunity. Poor options both, yes?[AN]
[FR]
That's only if we fight them directly.[N]
Instead, let's make use of the storm to[N]
hide our movements and surround TORCH.[AN]
With them pincered, they'll have nowhere[N]
to run. We'll be free to divide, conquer,[N]
and lop their leader's head clean off.[AN]
[R]
That is[Beat] a rather bold plan,[N]
but it works. I can helm one ship[N]
and bring whoever to accompany me.[AN]
[FR]
Good. Orlando, I'd ask you to take[N]
the other ship, but you'd probably[N]
run off with it when I'm not looking.[AN]
[FL]
Ah, such barbed words you speak, Lua![N]
Do you truly think I would abandon[N]
you all in your time of need?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]More importantly, Desiderio's got[N]
more respect from the others than you.[AN]
His boatsmanship could still use work,[N]
but it's good enough for this job.[N]
Pilar, tell Desiderio to get ready.[AN]
[R][ToggleSmile]
Of course. Let's hope that[N]
the oaf's piloting lessons[N]
pay off in time, eh?[AN]
[FR]
Oh, they will. Count on it.[A]
[R]
[Beat]I'll take your word for it.[N]
See you when the battle begins, Lua.[A][X]

[MR][3LB]
And as for you two, and everyone else[Beat][N]
I'll decide in advance who goes where.[AN]
This'll likely be our hardest battle yet,[N]
so I don't want to hear any complaining,[N]
no matter how new some of you might be.[AN]
[L]
Hey, what are you looking at me for?[N]
I'm just as much a pirate as anybody else[N]
here, now. You won't hear whining from me![AN]
[FL]
Haha! You really adapted quickly, Rahel![N]
As for me[Beat] I suppose that I can hold[N]
my commentary until the battle is won.[AN]
[MR]
Good. Tell everyone else in the crew[N]
that a fight's coming. Get them ready.[N]
As for me[Beat] It's time for some scouting.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadAlonso]
[ML]
What do you want, Alonso?[N]
I'm a little busy right now.[AN]
[MR]
Does a captain need a reason[N]
to chat with his first mate?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, but you always have one.[N]
Just make it quick, alright?[AN]
[MR]
Cold as always, eh Dalila?[AN]
Fine, fine, I won't waste your time.[N]
How's that Scorpio comin' along?[AN]
[ML]
The basic setup is finished.[AN]
It'll shoot any flier out of the sky[N]
and hurts everybody else just fine.[AN]
Could use some more fine tuning,[N]
but it'll do its job well enough.[AN]
[MR]
Glad to hear it. Somethin' tells me[N]
we'll be needin' it sooner than later.[AN]
We can't rely on TORCH to get the[N]
job done. Not the way we want it done.[AN]
[ML]
That's why we never should've joined[N]
TORCH and listened to their rules.[AN]
Weren't you always the one who said that[N]
anyone who crossed us would get theirs?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Are ya doubtin' my decision, Dalila?[N]
Ya think you'd have chose better?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MR][3LB]
Good. You're the only one who's got the[N]
stones to give me a piece of their mind.[AN]
I can't have you goin' soft on me,[N]
not before we finish the job[N]
and go back to our old ways.[AN]
[ML]
Huh? But[Beat] you signed us up to be[N]
privateers. Government lapdogs.[N]
What's with the change of heart?[A]
[MR]
I did that because we didn't have[N]
the power to hunt Lua's crew ourselves.[AN]
Would you have had me look the other way,[N]
when we can't even give Khazhak a burial?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, I wouldn't. But even so,[N]
I can't see any way back to the old days.[AN]
If we break our contract's terms now,[N]
the TORCH rats that are watching[N]
our every move won't let us off lightly.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. And even if we kill those bastards,[N]
they won't stop huntin' us after that.[AN]
The freedom we prided ourselves in[N]
is nothin' more than a mirage[Beat][N]
That's what you're thinkin', right?[AN]
But I wouldn't have signed that contract[N]
if I couldn't think of a way outta it.[N]
I ever steered us wrong before?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, you haven't.[AN]
[MR]
That's right, and I'm not startin' now.[AN]
The first problem's all these TORCH[N]
on my boat[Beat] but we've got a friend[N]
comin' who'll fix that, any second now.[AN]
[ML]
You don't mean[Beat] Lua?[AN]
[MR]
The enemy of my enemy ain't my friend,[N]
but she's a nice pawn on the board.[AN]
One that ain't gonna wait for us[N]
to chase her, if my guess's right.[AN]
Follow my call, and we'll make it[N]
through this, just like always.[N]
[Beat]You trust me, Dalila?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]My belief in you hasn't changed,[N]
not once since we first met.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You can rely on me, Alonso.[N]
Let's win back our freedom![A]
[MR]
Heh[Beat] That's what I like to hear![N]
Now, lemme go greet our friend[N]
and take 'er temperature[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_1
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
[ML]
Ho there, lady! No need to swing[N]
that gun 'a yours around, alright?[N]
Let's just talk for a second, first.[AN]
[MR]
Hmph[Beat] Fine, but don't think about[N]
escaping. We have your fleet surrounded.[AN]
[Beat]Wait, you're far too scruffy to be[N]
a TORCH officer. That must make you[N]
Alonso, then. The so-called Ebon Nerve?[AN]
[ML]
I see Nicodemus did his job, then.[N]
Good, that means I don't need[N]
to explain why I'm here to kill ya.[AN]
I won't be satisfied til you and[N]
the rest of your crew all get the[N]
same burial you gave to Khazhak![AN]
[MR]
Ha[Beat] Hahaha! Sorry, it's just hard[N]
to take you seriously when you're[N]
leading the scummiest crew around.[AN]
[ML]
Keep laughin', but I know what I am,[N]
and I've got no problem admittin' it.[AN]
Lootin', ransom, murder, you name it,[N]
I've done it with a smile on my face.[AN]
But some pirates, like you lot,[N]
get real uppity about morals[N]
when we're all bilge in the end.[AN]
If you want somethin', take it.[N]
If you hate someone, kill them.[N]
Ain't that the way life should be?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]We're criminals, not monsters.[N]
Any target of mine deserves their dues,[N]
and everyone else is off limits.[AN]
That's how I've always lived my life,[N]
even before I became a pirate,[N]
and I'm not changing that now.[AN]
For all the crimes you've committed[Beat][N]
I'll be the one to pass your sentence.[N]
Don't expect any clemency from me![A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Gahahaha! You've got some moxie, woman.[N]
I like that. Let's stop yappin', then,[N]
and get to killin' each other already.[AN]

[ML][3LB]
C-Captain, I felt a lot of shaking,[N]
and[Beat] W-What are those platforms?![N]
They're linking all of the ships![A]
[MR][3LB]
Looks like they're hovering the same[N]
way that airships do[Beat] I've never[N]
seen anything like this before.[AN]
Must be some kind of TORCH tech[N]
that Alonso got by bending the knee.[AN]
We won't be able to retreat until we[N]
can undo these links, since they're[N]
freezing all of our ships in place.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] That means defeating Alonso,[N]
but Blackhearts and TORCH both[N]
stand in the way of our path to him.[AN]
And if we take too long to trod it,[N]
the rest of TORCH may not be far behind.[N]
If they reach us, that would be[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Our doom. We can't take too long,[N]
and Alonso's too entrenched to blitz[Beat][N]
This'll be our hardest battle yet.[AN]
Looks like there are two paths to the[N]
center boat[Beat] Razvan, I need you[N]
to lead a group down the left one.[AN]
I'll handle the right path myself.[AN]
[ML]
Uh, I don't know if I'm ready-[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
You are. Take it from your captain.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]From my captain, hm? Fair enough.[N]
Then I'll discard all of my self-doubt![N]
I won't let you down, Captain Lua![A]
[MR]
Good. Now, let's take the initiative[N]
and get rid of these Blackhearts,[N]
once and for all! Follow my lead![A][X]

It seems that Lua's begun to move[Beat][N]
We won't have any backup from the[N]
main crew[Beat] Move carefully, everyone.[AN]
Dying here without reaching the Old World[N]
for yourselves would be a true waste[Beat][N][ToggleSmile][.4]
Protect each other and live to see it![AN][X]

Hm[Beat] Wait a second. That guy leadin'[N]

No way. That bum's leadin' a crew, now?[AN]

Heh, I didn't think she'd last[Beat][N]
But I always come out on top![AN]
Blackhearts, can you see that ship[N]

I would've liked to kill that wench[N]
myself, but this'll do well enough.[AN]

## LuaDefeatText
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
Hell[Beat] I wasn't fast enough,[N]
everyone. The Pirate Hunter's[N]
really got us, this time[Beat][AN]
There's no way out of this one.[N]
You all trusted me, and I failed.[N]
There's nothing I can do but apologize.[AN]
That, and take on the responsibility[N]
myself for this failed operation.[AN]
A captain goes down with the ship,[N]

Mm[Beat] Something feels off, though.[AN]
Pilar, Razvan. Gather the others[N]

Give it up, Alonso. You're through.[N]
Whatever agreement you had with[N]
Elodia won't save you from me.[AN]
But what might is your cooperation.[N]
Answer my questions, and you may[N]
just survive to live another day.[AN]
[ML]
You think I can't see the hate[N]
in your eyes, woman? Let's get real.[AN]
The moment I tell you what I know,[N]
I'll have a bullet in my gut.[N]
Ain't that right, Desiderio?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Heh. Yeah, that sounds like her.[N]
You've wised up a bit since we ran[N]
together in the Roseblades, Alonso.[AN]
Still, if you don't tell us anything,[N]
then you'll have worse comin' to you.[AN]
[ML]
Pah[Beat] Way it looks, it'll be comin'[N]
by your axe. Still a dog, Desiderio?[N]
Too afraid to make the hard calls?[AN]
[FR]
Doesn't matter who calls the shots,[N]
so long as I see eye to eye with 'em.[N]
Now, are you gonna comply, or not?[AN]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]Say your piece, and we'll see.[AN]
[R][3LB]
This technology you've used to lock us[N]
here[Beat] Why did TORCH give it[N]
to you, a pawn that they don't trust?[AN]
[ML]
Heh! Well, the feeling's mutual there.[AN]
If I had to guess, they hoped we'd kill[N]
each other enough so that they could[N]
finish the job. Worked well, didn't it?[AN]
Just like they wanted, us pirates[N]
are killin' each other instead of them.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Don't put our crews in the same boat.[N]
I don't need any incentive to kill a man[N]
like you, so they wasted their money.[AN]
[ML]
That so? Must be hard to talk to me,[N]
from atop that high horse 'a yours.[AN]
You think you're some executioner,[N]
but lemme tell ya somethin', Lua.[AN]
You keep sayin' you do what's right,[N]
but no matter how much good you do,[N]
the empire's eyes only see our sins.[AN]
In their view, we're both just[N]
lawbreakers who need to be put down.[N]
Why not just embrace that? Accept it?[AN]
[R]
[Beat]My moral compass doesn't sway to and[N]
fro based on what Incendivis's pen-pushers[N]
think. I do what I think's right, always.[AN]
That you'd even ask a question like that[N]
shows that under all that bravado,[N]
you're hollow, Alonso. You're nothing.[A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Heh. Well, you ain't far off,[N]
but hearin' that from a do-gooder[N]
like you makes me wanna hurl.[AN]
Still, I'm real thankful, Lua.[N]
All your yappin' bought me enough time.[N]
Look around, Skysabers. What do ya see?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[FR]
[Beat]Shit! Lua, there's a large armada[N]
headin' this way. They're not far, now[Beat][N]
It's gotta be the Pirate Hunter![AN]

So Alonso was just bait, after all[Beat][N]
Let's finish him off, Desiderio![AN]

It's a lucky thing that this one[N]
has all our essential supplies,[AN]
since there's no way we'll have[N]
time to secure the other two.[AN]
But now that I'm lookin' around,[N]
where the hell can we even go?[AN]
In front of us're hellish gales,[N]
and behind us're TORCH hounds.[AN]

One of these will kill us certainly,[N]
and the other will kill us possibly.[N]
Our path forward is clear. Right, Lua?[AN]
[Right][3LB]
Of course, we fly into the storm.[AN]
It's not the first time we've gambled[N]
with our lives, but if I can help it,[N]
it'll be the last for a while[Beat][AN]
Well, Pilar? Any nearby islands[N]
where we can make a landing?[AN]
[Left]
I know of a few. Let me take the wheel,[N]
and I'll do the best that I can.[AN]
No promises that our landing will be[N]
smooth, though. We might just crash[N]
