[ML]
Lua. How goes the planning?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
As well as it can, I guess.[AN]
The crew's grown fairly large,[N]
so there's a lot more paperwork[N]
to deal with and loot to dole out.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] My condolences. Anyway,[N]
I came here to give you a report.[N]
So far, the journey's been smooth.[AN]
But the weather indicates a storm[N]
is coming for us within the hour.[AN]
Our ships are well-equipped for it,[N]
thanks to Rahel and her carpentry,[N]
but we still need to be vigilant.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, Pilar. Hm[Beat] I should've[N]
known that flying to the Old[N]
World wouldn't be easy, but still[Beat][AN]
[ML]
You should have, yes. The Old World[N]
is largely unknown for a reason:[N]
the numerous storms circling it.[AN]
Truthfully, the one coming toward[N]
us appears relatively mild for the[N]
region. Certainly not a tempest.[AN]
[MR]
Then I guess I can't complain, huh?[N]
We can handle it. If we couldn't,[N]
then you'd have warned us off, right?[AN]
[ML]
Of course. The problem lies in what[N]
comes after we make it through, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll see soon enough.[AN][X]

[L]
C-Captain Lua, there's big trouble![N]
We have to get out of here, now![AN]
[FR]
Calm down, Rahel.[N]
What's the situation?[AN]
[FL]
Just a few friends behind us, is all.[N]
Ones bearing TORCH flags and grim faces.[AN]
[FR]
How few is few, exactly?[AN]
[L][3LB]
There was one really big ship,[N]
and about four smaller ones.[N]
They definitely outnumber us.[AN]
[FL]
I hoped that all of our misadventures[N]
in the outskirts threw TORCH off our tail,[N]
but it seems that was wishful thinking.[AN]
[FR]
Maybe. Either way, they've outnumbered[N]
us before, and we came out on top.[N]
Today won't be any different.[AN]
That said, we're not on our own turf,[N]
so we won't have the advantage here.[AN]
[FL]
Continuing to flee is still an option,[N]
one that I would personally recommend.[N]
I am a merchant at heart, not a fighter.[AN]
[R]
Yes, that much is clear. Think, Orlando.[N]
Turning our backs to them would only[N]
allow them to hunt us down freely.[AN]
[FL]
Yes, and turning our fronts to them[N]
would only allow them to run us through[N]
with impunity. Poor options both, yes?[AN]
[FR]
That's only if we fight them directly.[N]
Instead, let's make use of the storm to[N]
hide our movements and surround TORCH.[AN]
With them pincered, they'll have nowhere[N]
to run. We'll be free to divide, conquer,[N]
and lop their leader's head clean off.[AN]
[R]
That is[Beat] a rather bold plan,[N]
but it works. I can helm one ship[N]
and bring whoever to accompany me.[AN]
[FR]
Good. Orlando, I'd ask you to take[N]
the other ship, but you'd probably[N]
run off with it when I'm not looking.[AN]
[FL]
Ah, such barbed words you speak, Lua![N]
Do you truly think I would abandon[N]
you all in your time of need?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]More importantly, Desiderio's got[N]
more respect from the others than you.[AN]
His boatsmanship could still use work,[N]
but it's good enough for this job.[N]
Pilar, tell Desiderio to get ready.[AN]
[R][ToggleSmile]
Of course. Let's hope that[N]
the oaf's piloting lessons[N]
pay off in time, eh?[AN]
[FR]
Oh, they will. Count on it.[A]
[R]
[Beat]I'll take your word for it.[N]
See you when the battle begins, Lua.[A][X]

[MR][3LB]
And as for you two, and everyone else[Beat][N]
I'll decide in advance who goes where.[AN]
This'll likely be our hardest battle yet,[N]
so I don't want to hear any complaining,[N]
no matter how new some of you might be.[AN]
[L]
Hey, what are you looking at me for?[N]
I'm just as much a pirate as anybody else[N]
here, now. You won't hear whining from me![AN]
[FL]
Haha! You really adapted quickly, Rahel![N]
As for me[Beat] I suppose that I can hold[N]
my commentary until the battle is won.[AN]
[MR]
Good. Tell everyone else in the crew[N]
that a fight's coming. Get them ready.[N]
As for me[Beat] It's time for some scouting.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadAlonso]
[ML]
What do you want, Alonso?[N]
I'm a little busy right now.[AN]
[MR]
Does a captain need a reason[N]
to chat with his first mate?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, but you always have one.[N]
Just make it quick, alright?[AN]
[MR]
Cold as always, eh Dalila?[AN]
Fine, fine, I won't waste your time.[N]
How's that Scorpio comin' along?[AN]
[ML]
The basic setup is finished.[AN]
It'll shoot any flier out of the sky[N]
and hurts everybody else just fine.[AN]
Could use some more fine tuning,[N]
but it'll do its job well enough.[AN]
[MR]
Glad to hear it. Somethin' tells me[N]
we'll be needin' it sooner than later.[AN]
We can't rely on TORCH to get the[N]
job done. Not the way we want it done.[AN]
[ML]
That's why we never should've joined[N]
TORCH and listened to their rules.[AN]
Weren't you always the one who said that[N]
anyone who crossed us would get theirs?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Are ya doubtin' my decision, Dalila?[N]
Ya think you'd have chose better?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MR][3LB]
Good. You're the only one who's got the[N]
stones to give me a piece of their mind.[AN]
I can't have you goin' soft on me,[N]
not before we finish the job[N]
and go back to our old ways.[AN]
[ML]
Huh? But[Beat] you signed us up to be[N]
privateers. Government lapdogs.[N]
What's with the change of heart?[A]
[MR]
I did that because we didn't have[N]
the power to hunt Lua's crew ourselves.[AN]
Would you have had me look the other way,[N]
when we can't even give Khazhak a burial?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, I wouldn't. But even so,[N]
I can't see any way back to the old days.[AN]
If we break our contract's terms now,[N]
the TORCH rats that are watching[N]
our every move won't let us off lightly.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. And even if we kill those bastards,[N]
they won't stop huntin' us after that.[AN]
The freedom we prided ourselves in[N]
is nothin' more than a mirage[Beat][N]
That's what you're thinkin', right?[AN]
But I wouldn't have signed that contract[N]
if I couldn't think of a way outta it.[N]
I ever steered us wrong before?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, you haven't.[AN]
[MR]
That's right, and I'm not startin' now.[AN]
The first problem's all these TORCH[N]
on my boat[Beat] but we've got a friend[N]
comin' who'll fix that, any second now.[AN]
[ML]
You don't mean[Beat] Lua?[AN]
[MR]
The enemy of my enemy ain't my friend,[N]
but she's a nice pawn on the board.[AN]
One that ain't gonna wait for us[N]
to chase her, if my guess's right.[AN]
Follow my call, and we'll make it[N]
through this, just like always.[N]
[Beat]You trust me, Dalila?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]My belief in you hasn't changed,[N]
not once since we first met.[AN][ToggleSmile]
You can rely on me, Alonso.[N]
Let's win back our freedom![A]
[MR]
Heh[Beat] That's what I like to hear![N]
Now, lemme go greet our friend[N]
and take 'er temperature[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_1
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
[ML]
Ho there, lady! No need to swing[N]
that gun 'a yours around, alright?[N]
Let's just talk for a second, first.[AN]
[MR]
Hmph[Beat] Fine, but don't think about[N]
escaping. We have your fleet surrounded.[AN]
[Beat]Wait, you're far too scruffy to be[N]
a TORCH officer. That must make you[N]
Alonso, then. The so-called Ebon Nerve?[AN]
[ML]
I see Nicodemus did his job, then.[N]
Good, that means I don't need[N]
to explain why I'm here to kill ya.[AN]
I won't be satisfied til you and[N]
the rest of your crew all get the[N]
same burial you gave to Khazhak![AN]
[MR]
Ha[Beat] Hahaha! Sorry, it's just hard[N]
to take you seriously when you're[N]
leading the scummiest crew around.[AN]
[ML]
Keep laughin', but I know what I am,[N]
and I've got no problem admittin' it.[AN]
Lootin', ransom, murder, you name it,[N]
I've done it with a smile on my face.[AN]
But some pirates, like you lot,[N]
get real uppity about morals[N]
when we're all bilge in the end.[AN]
If you want somethin', take it.[N]
If you hate someone, kill them.[N]
Ain't that the way life should be?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]We're criminals, not monsters.[N]
Any target of mine deserves their dues,[N]
and everyone else is off limits.[AN]
That's how I've always lived my life,[N]
even before I became a pirate,[N]
and I'm not changing that now.[AN]
For all the crimes you've committed[Beat][N]
I'll be the one to pass your sentence.[N]
Don't expect any clemency from me![A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Gahahaha! You've got some moxie, woman.[N]
I like that. Let's stop yappin', then,[N]
and get to killin' each other already.[AN]

after all that talk 'a yours, [OQ]hero[CQ]![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_2
[MidLeft][LoadRazvan]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[ML][3LB]
C-Captain, I felt a lot of shaking,[N]
and[Beat] W-What are those platforms?![N]
They're linking all of the ships![A]
[MR][3LB]
Looks like they're hovering the same[N]
way that airships do[Beat] I've never[N]
seen anything like this before.[AN]
Must be some kind of TORCH tech[N]
that Alonso got by bending the knee.[AN]
We won't be able to retreat until we[N]
can undo these links, since they're[N]
freezing all of our ships in place.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] That means defeating Alonso,[N]
but Blackhearts and TORCH both[N]
stand in the way of our path to him.[AN]
And if we take too long to trod it,[N]
the rest of TORCH may not be far behind.[N]
If they reach us, that would be[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Our doom. We can't take too long,[N]
and Alonso's too entrenched to blitz[Beat][N]
This'll be our hardest battle yet.[AN]
Looks like there are two paths to the[N]
center boat[Beat] Razvan, I need you[N]
to lead a group down the left one.[AN]
I'll handle the right path myself.[AN]
[ML]
Uh, I don't know if I'm ready-[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
You are. Take it from your captain.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]From my captain, hm? Fair enough.[N]
Then I'll discard all of my self-doubt![N]
I won't let you down, Captain Lua![A]
[MR]
Good. Now, let's take the initiative[N]
and get rid of these Blackhearts,[N]
once and for all! Follow my lead![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Pilar
[ML][LoadPilar][3LB]
It seems that Lua's begun to move[Beat][N]
We won't have any backup from the[N]
main crew[Beat] Move carefully, everyone.[AN]
Dying here without reaching the Old World[N]
for yourselves would be a true waste[Beat][N][ToggleSmile][.4]
Protect each other and live to see it![AN][X]

Hm[Beat] Wait a second. That guy leadin'[N]

No way. That bum's leadin' a crew, now?[AN]

Heh, I didn't think she'd last[Beat][N]
But I always come out on top![AN]
Blackhearts, can you see that ship[N]

I would've liked to kill that wench[N]
myself, but this'll do well enough.[AN]

## LuaDefeatText
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
Hell[Beat] I wasn't fast enough,[N]
everyone. The Pirate Hunter's[N]
really got us, this time[Beat][AN]
There's no way out of this one.[N]
You all trusted me, and I failed.[N]
There's nothing I can do but apologize.[AN]
That, and take on the responsibility[N]
myself for this failed operation.[AN]
A captain goes down with the ship,[N]
right? Best of luck to you all.[N][.4][CloseEyes]

Mm[Beat] Something feels off, though.[AN]
Pilar, Razvan. Gather the others[N]
and start sawing the bridges off[N]

Give it up, Alonso. You're through.[N]
Whatever agreement you had with[N]
Elodia won't save you from me.[AN]
But what might is your cooperation.[N]
Answer my questions, and you may[N]
just survive to live another day.[AN]
[ML]
You think I can't see the hate[N]
in your eyes, woman? Let's get real.[AN]
The moment I tell you what I know,[N]
I'll have a bullet in my gut.[N]
Ain't that right, Desiderio?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Heh. Yeah, that sounds like her.[N]
You've wised up a bit since we ran[N]
together in the Roseblades, Alonso.[AN]
Still, if you don't tell us anything,[N]
then you'll have worse comin' to you.[AN]
[ML]
Pah[Beat] Way it looks, it'll be comin'[N]
by your axe. Still a dog, Desiderio?[N]
Too afraid to make the hard calls?[AN]
[FR]
Doesn't matter who calls the shots,[N]
so long as I see eye to eye with 'em.[N]
Now, are you gonna comply, or not?[AN]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]Say your piece, and we'll see.[AN]
[R][3LB]
This technology you've used to lock us[N]
here[Beat] Why did TORCH give it[N]
to you, a pawn that they don't trust?[AN]
[ML]
Heh! Well, the feeling's mutual there.[AN]
If I had to guess, they hoped we'd kill[N]
each other enough so that they could[N]
finish the job. Worked well, didn't it?[AN]
Just like they wanted, us pirates[N]
are killin' each other instead of them.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Don't put our crews in the same boat.[N]
I don't need any incentive to kill a man[N]
like you, so they wasted their money.[AN]
[ML]
That so? Must be hard to talk to me,[N]
from atop that high horse 'a yours.[AN]
You think you're some executioner,[N]
but lemme tell ya somethin', Lua.[AN]
You keep sayin' you do what's right,[N]
but no matter how much good you do,[N]
the empire's eyes only see our sins.[AN]
In their view, we're both just[N]
lawbreakers who need to be put down.[N]
Why not just embrace that? Accept it?[AN]
[R]
[Beat]My moral compass doesn't sway to and[N]
fro based on what Incendivis's pen-pushers[N]
think. I do what I think's right, always.[AN]
That you'd even ask a question like that[N]
shows that under all that bravado,[N]
you're hollow, Alonso. You're nothing.[A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Heh. Well, you ain't far off,[N]
but hearin' that from a do-gooder[N]
like you makes me wanna hurl.[AN]
Still, I'm real thankful, Lua.[N]
All your yappin' bought me enough time.[N]
Look around, Skysabers. What do ya see?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[FR]
[Beat]Shit! Lua, there's a large armada[N]
headin' this way. They're not far, now[Beat][N]
It's gotta be the Pirate Hunter![AN]
[R]
So Alonso was just bait, after all[Beat][N]
Let's finish him off, Desiderio![AN]

That bastard's craftier than I thought.[N]
We can't waste any time chasing him,[N]

Yes, the ship is free, Captain Lua.[N]
We can leave at any time![AN]

It's a lucky thing that this one[N]
has all our essential supplies,[AN]
since there's no way we'll have[N]
time to secure the other two.[AN]
But now that I'm lookin' around,[N]
where the hell can we even go?[AN]
In front of us're hellish gales,[N]
and behind us're TORCH hounds.[AN]
[Left][3LB]
One of these will kill us certainly,[N]
and the other will kill us possibly.[N]
Our path forward is clear. Right, Lua?[AN]
[Right][3LB]
Of course, we fly into the storm.[AN]
It's not the first time we've gambled[N]
with our lives, but if I can help it,[N]
it'll be the last for a while[Beat][AN]
Well, Pilar? Any nearby islands[N]
where we can make a landing?[AN]
[Left]
I know of a few. Let me take the wheel,[N]
and I'll do the best that I can.[AN]
No promises that our landing will be[N]
smooth, though. We might just crash[N]
and have to hope for the best.[AN]

Sounds like a good idea, Razvan.[N]
I'm counting on you, as usual.[N]

Heh heh heh[Beat] Lookie here![AN]
You've got nowhere to run,[N]
so how about you take a nap?[AN]
Fall into an eternal sleep![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoAttackedBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Heh, I guess my plans weren't[N]
enough to keep y'all away.[AN]
Fine, take your shot at me.[N]
I'll pay it back tenfold![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaAttackerBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
You should've stayed far away[N]
if you wanted to live today.[AN]
My preparations are perfect[Beat][N]
Feel the sting of my arrows[A][X]

## Ch3DalilaAttackedBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
Damn, you all got this close?[N]
Ah, this is gonna hurt[Beat][AN]
If I make it through this,[N]
you are dead! Hear me? Dead![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoLuaBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Looks like you aren't[N]
all talk after all, Lua.[AN]
If you've got anythin' to say,[N]
get it out before we fight.[AN]
I'm a courteous man,[N]
so I won't interrupt.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Ha! I've got nothing to say[N]
to a man like you, Alonso.[AN]
Except[Beat] That if I had the[N]
chance to do it all again,[AN]
I'd have sent you Khazhak[N]
once we reached Port Greagor.[AN]
He was a bastard, sure, but[N]
he still deserved a burial.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]Well, it ain't like it'd[N]
have mattered. Either way,[AN]
we'd both be standin' here[N]
ready to kill each other.[AN]
This is how it was meant[N]
to be[Beat][A] So let's end this,[N]
here and now! Come at me![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Don't have to tell me twice![AN]
The Blackhearts die today,[N]
Alonso! And you with them![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoDesiderioBQ
[MidRight][LoadDesiderio]
Looks like you're still[N]
kickin', Alonso. Gotta say,[AN]
I thought a rat like you[N]
woulda died in some alley.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
And you are[Beat]?[N]
Ah, I remember you now![AN]
You were a member of that[N]
fool's crew. Desiderio![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDesiderio]
That's my name. Honestly,[N]
even though you're scum,[AN]
I always respected your grit.[N]
But to think, you're a captain[Beat][AN]
Do any of 'em know just how[N]
much of a fraud you are?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]A fraud? Don't know what[N]
ya mean. I'm Alonso, the Ebon-[AN]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
You're not. See, our old boss[N]
did some diggin' when you left.[AN]
This Ebon Nerve[Beat] Couldn't[N]
find a soul who knew you.[AN]
No old crews to back up your[N]
claims, no grand heists.[AN]
So tell me somethin', before[N]
I leave you bleedin' out[Beat][AN]
Who the hell are you, Alonso?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML]
[Beat]Heh. Ha ha ha ha![AN]
A good question, Desiderio.[N]
But it's like I always said:[AN]
Deceive before you can be[N]
deceived. Remember that?[AN]
When ya deceive well enough,[N]
ya make lies into truth.[AN]
All that it takes to keep[N]
up the act[Beat] is killin' you![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoOrlandoBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
An old man, really?[AN]
Lua must be runnin' out[N]
of bodies if you're here.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadOrlando]
Ah, what an original insult![AN]
I must say, you're the[N]
embodiment of wit, friend.[AN]
Perhaps you'd like to share[N]
your jokes with my crew?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Oh, I get it! You're stallin'[N]
for time. Not bad, geezer,[AN]
but I'm not fallin' for that.[AN]
Lemme give you an early[N]
retirement, right now![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadOrlando]
Just try it, if you can.[AN]
I haven't lived this long[N]
to die to a man like you![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoCarmenBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Oh? You're in Lua's crew?[AN]
Honestly, you don't look[N]
much like a pirate, lass.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCarmen]
Correct, I am no mere pirate.[N]
I am a musician! A virtuoso![AN]
And unlike you, Captain Lua[N]
appreciates my many talents.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]Really? She's an odd duck,[N]
but that's stranger still.[AN]
Well, with the way you're[N]
dressed, you must be rich.[AN]
How about I take you hostage[N]
and see if anyone cares?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCarmen]
Hmph! Even if I could return,[N]
I found a place to belong.[AN]
Captain Lua believed in me[Beat][AN]
Now, I will repay that faith.[N]
Listen, boar, to your requiem![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoXimoBQ
[MidRight][LoadXimo]
You must be the boss of the[N]
Blackhearts. Alonso, right?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
'Course I am. And you[Beat][AN]
Well, you just look like[N]
an ordinary bloke, huh?[AN]
I could find ten losers like[N]
you in any ol' port town.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadXimo]
Heh, you're right.[N]
Or you used to be, anyway.[AN]
But Captain Lua taught me how[N]
to be someone more than that.[AN]
People trust me now to do big[N]
things, to get the job done[Beat][AN]
I'm not gonna let them down.[N]
You're just target practice![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoErnestBQ
[MidRight][LoadErnest]
Alonso[Beat] So, you're the same[N]
guy from the Roseblades, hm?[AN]
Now I see why the captain[N]
kicked you from the crew.[AN]
She must have seen how[N]
rotten you really were.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
No, she was afraid that[N]
I'd take her place![AN]
Look at all the people[N]
that I've gathered here.[AN]
Every last one of them?[N]
A lowlife, without question.[AN]
I've taken them under my[N]
wing and changed their lives.[AN]
Now, they have a place;[N]
now, they have a purpose![AN]
That's the mark of a leader,[N]
uh[Beat] Whoever you are.[AN]
And your captain feared that.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
Ernest. Regardless, you're[N]
delusional as always.[AN]
These Blackhearts follow you[N]
without question, right?[AN]
And if they do otherwise,[N]
then they lose their place,[AN]
forced to return to their[N]
meaningless everyday lives.[AN]
That means you're no leader;[N]
you're a tyrant, Alonso![AN]
And unlike my captain,[N]
I will not abide it.[AN]
I'll end this charade,[N]
right here and right now![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaPilarBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
What do you want, old-timer?[N]
Get moving, or I'll shoot.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadPilar]
Do you have eyes, girl?[N]
I have a knife in my hand.[AN]
Take this seriously,[N]
or you'll find it in your gut.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Heh[Beat] Am I supposed[N]
to be scared of you?[AN]
I grew up in a shithole town[N]
with nothing to live for.[AN]
Every day, all I could do[N]
was survive til the next one,[AN]
but then Alonso came along.[AN]
He pulled me out of that[N]
place and gave me a new life.[AN]
Here, I'm needed, wanted.[N]
Even if I die here to you,[AN]
I'll have served my purpose[N]
to him and the whole crew.[AN]
That's all that matters![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadPilar]
[Beat]Is that so? I pity you.[AN]
You're no more than a puppet[N]
who can't see her strings.[AN]
You could be so much more[Beat][AN]
But if that's how you wish[N]
to live your life, so be it![AN][X]

## Ch3DalilaRazvanBQ
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
You[Beat] I remember you![AN]
You led a group of Blackhearts[N]
in raiding a marine ship.[AN]
I couldn't fight back,[N]
so you spared my life,[AN]
but you killed everyone else[N]
and left me alone, stranded.[AN]
Does that ring any bells?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
[Beat]Too many to count.[AN]
I have no idea who you are[N]
or when this happened,[AN]
but if you want an apology,[N]
then you'll be disappointed.[AN]
Honestly, you should thank me.[AN]
If it was Alonso leading it,[N]
you wouldn't be standing here.[AN]
[OQ]No loose ends[CQ], he says[Beat][N]
I should have listened.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
Yes, you should have listened.[N]
Not to him, your conscience![AN]
Whatever shred of it you had[N]
that made you spare me[Beat][AN]
Let me thank it and apologize.[AN]
Because now, I'm no longer[N]
defenseless.[A] I'm no longer[N]
alone, crying out for justice![AN]
And I will no longer tolerate[N]
devils like you in this world![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaRahelBQ
[MidRight][LoadRahel]
Wow, that's a neat ballista![N]
Did you make it yourself?[AN]
I've always wanted one that[N]
I could use on horseback,[AN]
but they're all so heavy[Beat][AN]
That one seems pretty light,[N]
though. It's impressive work![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Uh, thanks, but why are you[N]
praising me right now, kid?[AN]
You know we're enemies, right?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRahel]
Huh? Oh, I couldn't help[N]
myself when I saw it.[AN]
You know how it is, right?[AN]
When an inventor sees a cool[N]
gadget, everything else can wait.[AN]
Still, it's a real shame that[N]
we have to fight each other[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
But if it's either you or me,[N]
then I'm always picking me.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
[Beat]Heh. Isn't that the truth?[AN]
That's what it means to be[N]
a pirate[Beat] To be who you are,[AN]
no matter what anyone thinks.[AN]
Whether I'm viewed as a liar,[N]
a thief, or a cruel killer[Beat][AN]
So long as I can live my way,[N]
then I couldn't care less![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRahel][ToggleSmile]
Hm[Beat] If Master Ida never took[N]
me in, maybe I'd feel the same.[AN]
But she taught me that doing[N]
good's always worth it,[AN]
and to pay it forward when[N]
people help you out, too.[AN]
And Captain Lua taught me[N]
something important, too:[AN]
no matter what side of the law[N]
you're on, it doesn't matter.[AN][ToggleSmile]
A woman's gotta have a code![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Such a naive response[Beat][AN]
Well, tell me, girl.[N]
What's this code?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRahel]
It's a simple one, really.[AN]
To back up my captain and[N]
crewmates, no matter what![AN]
[Beat]Just don't tell Orlando[N]
or the captain that, though.[AN]
I'd die of embarrassment![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Ha[Beat] No need to worry about[N]
that, little inventor.[AN]
You'll die by my bolts before[N]
that happens. I promise![AN][X]

## Ch3DalilaFataBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
I've got you in my sights[Beat][AN]
There's nowhere to run,[N]
so don't bother trying.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadFata]
Bah, I'm not running![AN]
The dog you sent after Lua[N]
came biting at my heels, too.[AN]
Nicodemus was his name.[AN]
He brought a battle to[N]
my home and angered me,[AN]
enough for me to fight again.[N]
He disturbed my peace![AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
What? Gods below, I knew[N]
he was completely useless[Beat][AN]
Look, I'll let you walk away.[AN]
It's not like you're our[N]
target, so if you do,[AN]
I won't come after you.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadFata]
Oh, it's far too late for that![N]
You awoke a firestarter, girl.[AN]
Don't be surprised when[N]
you get burned![A][X]
