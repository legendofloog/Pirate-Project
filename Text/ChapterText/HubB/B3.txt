[Left][3LB]
Here we are. Not much more than[N]
a ghost town, but this is Snowthorne.[AN]
There used to be a little port here[N]
and a tavern, but they did business[N]
with us. Ended up payin' the price.[AN]
TORCH seized their goods and gold,[N]
and for good measure, ran them out.[AN]
[FarLeft]
That's[Beat] You're saying the empire[N]
retaliated against civilians?[AN]
I can't imagine someone like[N]
Miss Elodia would have allowed that,[N]
even if they operated dubiously.[AN]
[FarRight]
Maybe so, but a single cog[N]
only has so much power.[N]
And that is all she is.[AN]
[Left]
Mm. All it takes is a bigger fish[N]
and a bribe, and you get this.[AN]
If I had to bet, I'd say Rogelio ratted[N]
out what kinda treasure we had[N]
and offered to split it with them.[AN]
TORCH took with them bags and bags[N]
of our loot, stuff we hid real well.[AN]
Not all of it, but enough for me[N]
to figure that they knew where it was.[AN]
[Right]
Well, I just hope they haven't made[N]
a return visit in the last five years.[N]
Which way to the fort, Desiderio?[AN]
[Left]
Ah, it's just a stone's throw north.[N]
Follow me, and watch where you walk.[N]
Might be bear crap under the snow.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][2LB]
[Beat]Puerile, as usual.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
B-Bear? Wait, don't leave me behind![A][X]


## HubB3BeginningScene1_2
[FarLeft][LoadLua]
[Left][LoadDesiderio]
Hm[Beat] Hasn't aged a day.[N]
Boss, you see a griffin anywhere?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Huh? Well, no.[N]
Why's that?[AN]
[Left]
Just makin' sure we don't get[N]
surprised by my old[Beat] friend.[AN]
We didn't exactly break on good terms,[N]
so I'm not sure where we stand.[A]
[FarLeft]
Couldn't you have told me that[N]
before we landed here, Desiderio?[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Yes, your captain raises a good point.[N]
What if I wanted to spear you through?[AN]
[Left]
Damn, that voice! Duck, boss![A][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene1_3A
[FarLeft][LoadLua]
[Left][LoadDesiderio]
[MidRight][LoadErnest]
Bahaha! You actually thought I'd do it?[N]
Come now, Desi. I'm not that jilted.[AN]
[FarLeft]
A white griffin[Beat] No wonder I didn't[N]
see you coming. What a majestic beast.[AN]
[MR]
Gerome is a bit of a looker, isn't he?[AN]
Well, if Desiderio's cries ring true,[N]
you must be his new captain, I presume.[AN]
[FL]
You've got good ears. That's right,[N]
and you must be his old friend.[AN]
[MR]
Friend, huh? Not exactly how'd I put it.[N]
But yes, I'm Ernest. It's a pleasure.[AN]
[L]
Er, it's[Beat] It's good to see you,[N]
Ernie. You haven't aged a day.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, I owe it to the lack of sun.[AN]
It keeps my skin nice and smooth,[N]
even if I'm halfway to freezing.[AN]
[Beat]So, why are you really here?[N]
Not for pleasantries, I hope.[AN]
[L]
That's[Beat][AN]
[FL][3LB]
We're preparing to travel a long way,[N]
to parts unknown, and we need fuel.[N]
Desiderio said there was plenty here.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]Is that so? I respect the honesty.[N]
Tell me; why should I let you have it?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Using the fuel just to survive is a waste.[AN]
If Desiderio's right about the amount,[N]
do you think your captain would look[N]
fondly at it being burned away here?[AN]
Shouldn't it be used for something[N]
greater, to honor their memory?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
And what do you know of our captain?[N]
You're nothing more than an outsider.[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Any leader[Beat] any GOOD leader,[N]
wants the best for their group.[N]
Is this the best that you can do?[AN]
Wasting away your life in frigid[N]
isolation, just waiting to die?[N]
Would your dead captain be proud?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Hmph. You know, all you had to say[N]
was that you had a whole crew behind you.[N]
Why not do that and spare me the lecture?[A]
[FL]
Simple. I get the feeling you'd have[N]
one man in your corner, if I did.[N]
And I happen to want him on my side.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Read me like a book, huh?[AN]
Well, that's how it is, Ernie.[N]
I'm not the best with words,[N]
but what she said's why I left.[AN]
And I think you should, too.[AN]
We're headed to the edge of the world,[N]
just like the captain dreamed about.[N]
I[Beat] I'd like it if you came with us.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Just like Francisca did, hm?[AN]
I'm not sure I'm ready for the change,[N]
but give me the night to consider it.[AN]
I wager you don't want to sleep[N]
in your ships, so if you'd like,[N]
you can sleep in the fort tonight.[AN]
I've got a fair amount of food,[N]
so help yourself to what you like.[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Best not regret that.[N]
These pigs have big appetites,[N]
speaking from experience.[AN]
[MR]
I'm sure none of them match Desi.[N]
One time, when we were raiding[N]
a merchant ship, the man-[AN]
[L]
The boss doesn't need to hear that![N]
But uh, thanks, Ernie. Seriously.[AN]
[MR]
Honestly, I'm just glad to have visitors.[N]
It's been lonely since you left,[N]
Desi. I really[Beat] really missed you.[A]
[L][2LB]
[Beat]Ernie, I-[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Hm[Beat] Not to interrupt the two of you,[N]
but can you point us to the bedrooms?[AN]
I don't want to spend another minute[N]
out in this cold, if I can help it.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
A-Ah, right. Your crew can follow me[N]
and divvy up the rooms as you like.[AN]
Desi, yours is just as you left it.[N]
I'll swing by later, alright?[N]
We've got a lot to catch up on.[A]
[L][2LB]
Er, sure, of course.[N]
I'll see you then.[A]
[L][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR][ClearFace][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene1_3B
[FL][LoadLua]
[Beat]So this is why Desiderio[N]
really wanted to come back.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Well, it looks like the trip[N]
was worth it, after all.[A][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_1A
[MidRight][LoadRazvan][CloseEyes][TMM]
(...[.4][OpenEyes][TMM]
Mm, I knew it. I can't sleep[N]
when I'm not in my own quarters.[AN]
What to do, what to do...)[.4][AN][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_1B
[MidRight][LoadRazvan][TMM]
(Maybe a quick walk will[N]
help speed up the process.[AN][CloseEyes]
Or at least, it'll work off the sweets[N]
the captain kept pushing me to eat...[.4])[AN][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_2
[MidRight][LoadRazvan][TMM]
(Wait, is that Desiderio?[AN]
I guess he had a hard time sleeping,[N]
too...[.4] But he's out in the cold![AN]
I'd better see what's up with him.)[A][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_3A
[MidLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
Desiderio, what are you doing here?[AN]
It's far too frigid to be[N]
standing around in the snow.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Oh, Razvan. I was just[Beat][N]
thinkin' about old times.[AN]
This is where me and the crew[N]
used to gather after a job.[AN]
There's somethin' special about[N]
the soil here in this fort, y'see.[AN]
No matter how cold it gets,[N]
or how the storms howl,[N]
a bed of blue roses thrives here.[AN]
[MR]
Oh, you're right! They're quite[N]
breathtaking, but even so, we-[.4][N]
Wait, over there, are those[Beat][AN][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_3B
[FarLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[Left][LoadRazvan]
[L]
[Beat][AN]
[FL][3LB]
[Beat]They're graves, for each[N]
of our crew that died here.[AN]
The captain[Beat] Francisca, her name was.[N]
She's the one in the middle there.[AN]
Always told us that if she went down,[N]
this is where she wanted to rest.[N]
[Beat]Never knew how quick we'd have to dig.[AN][CSS]
[L][CF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[MR]
I[Beat] I'm truly sorry. I had no idea[N]
that this place held so much meaning[N]
for you, or I never would have-[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Save it. She'd tell me the same thing,[N]
and so would Ernest, if he saw me here.[N]
Good thing the man's a heavy sleeper.[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
That reminds me. I don't mean to pry,[N]
but what exactly are you two?[AN]
You said friends, but it doesn't quite[N]
feel like how you and the captain are.[N]
There's something I can't place.[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Ha! Gotta say, I'm surprised at how[N]
sharp but clueless you are, kid.[AN]
We're [OQ]friends[CQ] in the same way[N]
your mother and father were.[N]
Does that make it clear enough?[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile][MoMR]
Y-Yes. Though[Beat] I never knew my[N]
father, so not as well as I'd like.[AN]
My mother never spoke of him,[N]
and I can't say I understand[N]
the feelings she may have had.[AN]
I've never felt them myself.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Oh, man, I had no idea[Beat][N]
Sorry, didn't mean to hit a nerve.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
It's fine. I feel nothing towards him.[N]
He wasn't there when I first walked,[N]
nor when I first spoke, or wrote[Beat][AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Sometimes, it's better that way.[N]
Better to have them out of your life[N]
than in it so they can make it worse.[AN]
I realized that, so I left home[N]
and decided to make my own path.[AN]
One my father couldn't force me down,[N]
or that my mother could silently judge.[AN]
I may be nothin' more than a pirate,[N]
but at least I'm free to act as I will.[N]
To love, and to live, as I will.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I'll admit, I still have contempt[N]
for piracy, even after becoming one.[AN]
I've experienced too much of its effects[N]
in my own town to ever truly embrace it,[N]
or to accept the excesses it encourages.[AN]
But I can't deny that the freedom we're[N]
afforded is something I've always,[N]
always wanted, ever since I was young.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Sounds like there's a story there.[N]
Well, go on. Lay it on me, Razvan.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]My mother placed pressure on me from[N]
a young age to study a craft endlessly,[N]
with the hopes I'd escape the outskirts.[AN]
People that stayed there never prospered,[N]
and she didn't want that life for me.[AN]
I was grateful, because I knew how much[N]
she cared, but still, I felt[Beat] trapped.[N]
Trapped by her expectations and my own.[AN]
That I'd become a prominent official[N]
and pull us out of that dreaded pit,[N]
and one day, start my own happy family.[AN]
The one she never was able to have,[N]
because of me[Beat] But I never wanted that![AN]
Obviously, I'm a criminal now,[N]
but even if I'd never joined this crew,[AN]
I don't think I would've made it[N]
to Imperial Healer like my mentor,[N]
or stayed with the marines at all.[AN]
[Beat]And I don't know if I'll ever[N]
find someone that I truly love,[N]
or if I'm capable of that at all.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Take it from me, Razvan. You don't[N]
need a woman, or anyone, really.[AN]
Some people never feel that desire,[N]
and there's nothin' wrong with that.[AN]
What matters is livin' life in a way[N]
that you won't regret when you bite it.[AN]
That's what Francisca always said[Beat][N]
And it's how I've lived ever since.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
It may take some time for me to think[N]
that way, but still, thank you for the[N]
advice, Desiderio. And for listening.[AN]
I've had a lot on my mind, recently.[N][ToggleSmile]
And[Beat] thank you for confiding in me,[N]
as well. I won't say a word, promise.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Well, I've got no big secrets,[N]
but I appreciate it. Really.[AN]
[Beat]Anyway, it's long past[N]
your bedtime, kid. Get some sleep.[AN]
[MR]
O-Oh, I suppose that it is![N]
Good night, Desiderio. Thank you again![A][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_3C
[FL][LoadDesiderio][2LB]
[Beat]Live in a way you wouldn't regret,[N]
huh? I should practice what I preach.[AN][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene2_3D
[FL][LoadDesiderio][3LB]
[Beat]All this time, I've been runnin' away[N]
from what happened to you, Francisca.[N]
To you, and to everyone else[Beat][AN]
But I swear, on these frozen graves,[N]
I'll kill that bastard Rogelio,[N]
even if I have to die to do it![AN][X]

## HubB3BeginningScene3_1A
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Hell, I overslept big time.[AN]
It's not like me to drop my guard,[N]
but old habits die hard, I guess.[AN]
Now, where did I put my axe[Beat][AN]
[FFR]
You'd better find it quick, Desiderio![AN][X]

Ernest spotted an unknown group in[N]
the fort, and they don't look friendly.[AN]

What?! Damn, of course this happens[N]
the one time I come back here![AN]
Alright, I'll be out there soon.[AN]
Don't get the party started[N]
til I'm ready to show out, boss![A]

Wouldn't dream of it.[N]
Just make it snappy![A][X]

[L][LoadErnest]
[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[R]
What's the current situation,[N]
Ernest? I've brought Desiderio.[AN]
[L][3LB]
They've infiltrated the fort,[N]
I'm afraid.[A] We installed a few[N]
secret passages, for our use,[N]
but it seems they located one.[AN]
Last night, I'd begun opening[N]
our cache of fuel to make it[N]
quicker to grab it in the morning.[AN]
And, well[Beat] they've found it,[N]
along with hijacking your airship.[AN]
If we let them go, they'll take it,[N]
and you'll be stuck here, I'm afraid.[AN]
[FR]
Wait, how'd they even get in here?[AN]
We hid those passages pretty well,[N]
so not just anyone can find 'em.[AN]
[Beat]Ernie, you thinkin' what I am?[AN]
[L]
It's a distinct possibility, Desi.[AN]
After betraying us, I caught wind[N]
about some of Rogelio's activities.[AN]
Among them was affiliation with a group[N]
known for dissidence against the empire.[N]
They call themselves the Unchained.[AN]
[FR]
Well, that just makes it all clear.[AN]
Boss, let's take out every one of 'em[N]
and force their leader to fess up.[AN]
I'm not lettin' a chance to hunt down[N]
Rogelio pass by without takin' it.[AN]
[FL]
Don't let your feelings interfere,[N]
Desiderio. Our objective is the fuel,[N]
along with stopping them from escaping.[AN]
Slaughtering the enemy isn't required.[A]
[FR][2LB]
Sure, but MY objective's to get even.[AN]
We can kill two birds with one stone,[N]
unless you've got a reason not to.[AN]
[FL]
The ones with fuel flee as we speak.[AN]
Would you drop an axe in their back?[N]
I never thought you were a coward.[AN]
[FR][CloseEyes]
[Beat]Pilar, I'm not in the mood for this.[N]
Don't get in my way, or you'll regret-[AN]
[L][3LB]
Desi! I understand your anger,[N]
but she's right. Fighting someone[N]
who wants only to flee is wrong.[AN]
If we can, let's try to steal the fuel[N]
back without killing any of them,[N]
while capturing their leader.[AN]
I think[Beat] that's what our captain[N]
would do. Wouldn't you agree?[AN]
[FR][2LB][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Fine. That means you're[N]
fightin' with us, after all?[AN]
[L]
Of course. That fuel belongs to us,[N]
so I won't let any outsiders take it![AN]
With Gerome here, I'm quite useful,[N]
though less so if we weren't indoors.[AN]
Still, I'm used to fighting on foot,[N]
so say the word, and I'll dismount.[AN]
I'm not as fast on foot, though,[N]
so keep that in mind, alright?[AN]
[R][3LB]
You got it. And welcome aboard,[N]
even if it's just temporary.[AN]
I'm not fond of the idea of[N]
living here forever, no offense,[N]
so let's prioritize their leader.[AN]
Don't get cocky and let her escape,[N]
or we won't get off this damn island.[N]
Those are orders, Desiderio, Pilar.[AN]
[FL][1LB]
No objections here.[AN]
[FR]
Me neither. Let's get to work![A][X]

## B3AzaharIntroduction
[ML][LoadAzahar]
Looks like these fools wised up,[N]
but it's too little, too late.[AN]
Any of you who got your grubby[N]
hands on fuel, start running![AN]
The rest of y'all have to survive[N]
until everyone's made it out,[AN]
if you want a cut of the spoils.[AN]
[Beat]Well, I'll leave early if any[N]
of them don't make it this far.[AN]
Not like any of 'em are more[N]
than cannon fodder, anyway![A][X]

## B3AzaharWarningText
[ML][LoadAzahar][3LB]
Looks like our airship's about[N]
ready to go[Beat] Not much longer now,[N]
and we'll be clear of these fools![A][X]

## B3AzaharEscapesText_1
[MidLeft][LoadAzahar][3LB]
Alright, we're gettin' the hell[N]
out of here! The airship's ready,[N]
so anyone who wants to live, run![AN][X]

## B3AzaharEscapesText_2
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Shit! There's no way we can catch up[N]
in time[Beat] This is all my fault.[AN]
With this island being so off path,[N]
forget sailing into the Old World.[N]
We may be stuck here a long, long time[Beat][A][X]

## B3MapObjectiveExplanation
Lua's army can retrieve the fuel[N]
by defeating the marked thieves[N]
or Stealing, gaining their Spoils.[AN]
These Spoils carry other useful[N]
items, with greater rewards[N]
for each one of them gained.[AN]
Once all the thieves have fallen or[N]
escaped, or when she's waited 10 turns,[N]
Azahar will flee as well.[AN]
Her escape will lead to a [Red]Game Over.[Red][A][X]

## B3KaiIntroduction
[ML][LoadKai]
Hell[Beat] This isn't what I signed up for![AN]
Why should I stick my neck out[N]
for those slowpokes with the goods?[AN]
Maybe I'll just hightail it out[N]
before anyone notices I'm here[Beat][A][X]

## B3KaiFleeWarning
[ML][LoadKai]
Alright, that's it.[AN]
There's no way I'm dyin' because[N]
the boss messed up, not a chance.[AN]
She can take the fall for all this,[N]
and I'll take my exit, stage left.[AN]

You'd let some random thief join you?[N]
You guys must really be hard up.[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile][3LB]
Perhaps. But I can sense you have skill,[N]
skill which you have left untapped.[AN]
If you wish to be nothing more than[N]

Plenty of people here had nowhere else[N]
to go, but they had the skills to catch[N]
my eye[Beat] And you're no exception.[AN]
It's a damn shame how you're using them,[N]
but if you want to steal for a living[N]
and never dream bigger, be my guest.[AN]

to belong, you've got a chance with us.[A]

I'll introduce you to Pilar.[AN]
She might be a bit demanding,[N]
but she'll show you the ropes.[N]
You can handle it, I'm sure.[AN]
For now though, back me up.[N]
Don't hold back on your old pals![A]

[MR][LoadLeandra][3LB]
Gotta say, I never thought[N]
I'd see you again, Ernie.[AN]
When you and Desi stayed behind,[N]
I figured you'd both stay here[N]
and never fly a new flag again.[AN]
[ML]
As did I, but Captain Lua's offer[N]
sways me the more I think on it.[N]
I understand why Desi chose her.[AN]
She has a good head on her shoulders[N]
and ambitions more noble than many[N]
in our line of work, wouldn't you say?[AN]
[MR]
You can't really call it work, but yeah,[N]
I agree. Room and board, fair rules,[N]
and work that doesn't eat at me[Beat][AN]
What else could a woman want?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
A bit of purpose, I'd hope,[N]
but you always took it easy.[N]
[MR][3LB]
And you always took it hard.[N]
It's why I was worried when[N]
I saw Desi all on his lonesome.[AN]
I really thought you bit it, Ernie.[N]
There aren't many other ways[N]
to separate two lovebirds.[AN]
[ML]
Ha! Fortunately, I'm very alive.[N]
Desi wanted me to come along with him,[N]
but I[Beat] I couldn't leave this place.[AN]
I felt that if it was abandoned,[N]
all the memories our crew made here[N]
would fade away and be forgotten.[AN]
Someone, anyone, had to remember it.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]Memories belong in the past, Ernie.[AN]
If you get too caught up in them,[N]
then you're not really living.[AN]
That's why nobody, not even the captain,[N]
would ask you to stay here forever.[AN]
They'd want you to live the life[N]
that they couldn't, if you ask me.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'll think it over, Leandra.[AN]
But for now, we have something to do[N]
to make sure they rest well, right?[AN]
Let's send these thieves packing![AN][X]

You want those to be your last words?[N]
If not, then I'll say it one more time.[N]
Tell me what I want to know, or-[AN]

Look, I really don't like Rogelio,[N]

No matter what I say, I'm dead.[AN]

Rogelio's the one who organized this[N]
crew, y'see. Must've been soon after[N]
he stabbed your captain in the back,[AN]
because he could never stop lookin'[N]
over his shoulder and dartin' his eyes.[AN]
I was just in it for the loot,[N]

We did good work for a few years,[N]
but he saw that the rest of us didn't[N]
have that same drive that he did.[AN]
So he took off, though it's hard for me[N]

that no one'd be able to find him,[AN]

Of course. She held up her end,[N]

Don't need to tell me twice, woman.[AN]

I stole it from here to begin with,[N]

back, but I was[Beat] afraid of what I'd see.[AN]

I was afraid too, Desi.[AN]
I always told myself that if I left,[N]
the time that we all spent here would[N]
fade away, with our memories of them.[AN]
But I was just afraid of change,[N]
and guilty of my own part in their[N]
deaths. My failure to scout out TORCH-[AN]
[MR]
It ain't your fault, Ernie. Not at all.[N]
There's only one man to blame, here.[N]
One backstabber who did this to us![AN]
[Beat]One way or another, I'm gonna[N]
find that rat bastard Rogelio,[N]
and I'm gonna kill him. I swear.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]And I'll be right there with you,[N]
to honor the memory of our crew[N]
that trusted him and paid the price.[AN]
But Captain Francisca wouldn't want[N]
us to be consumed by that goal, right?[N]
We need something else to live for, too.[AN]

Hm[Beat] You've got a point, Ernie.[N]
But I can't think of anythin'[N]
I want to do but be a pirate.[AN]
Even when my hairs grow gray,[N]
I'll be sailin' these skies and[N]
takin' from those who deserve it.[AN]
But, well[Beat] Maybe I'd want to be[N]
sailin' with somebody by my side,[N]
til I fall to the Lands Below.[AN]
[Beat]You, uh, catch my drift, right?[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile][2LB]
It's not a very subtle one, so yes.[N]
[Beat]That's my answer, too, by the way.[AN]
As long as you don't run away again,[N]
