Oh, it's bad![A]

Hm? You're[Beat] Dario,[N]
that town guard, right?[AN]
What's the issue?[A]
[MR]
Lady Magdalena,[N]
she[Beat] she's dead![AN]
I found her in the woods,[N]
stabbed like Father Gavriel![A]
[ML]
Damn! This must be the[N]
work of the murderer[Beat][AN]
but I thought we[N]
already imprisoned-[A]
[MR]
And Cruz fled town![AN]
He ran out into the[N]
woods and never came back![A]
[ML]
So, we[Beat] we pinned the[N]

At least our supplies are-[A][CSSCF]

Even in death, the[N]

leaves us no choice[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
In death?[AN]
Guessing that's what that[N]

[FR]
I-it's Dario.[AN]
And[Beat] and Cruz killed[N]
Lady Magdalena and fled![A]
[ML]
It was Cruz? Bah.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Let myself get too[N]
focused on that soldier,[AN]
and missed the real threat[Beat][OpenEyes][A]

If our supplies are gone[N]
and the port's leader is dead,[AN]
then we've no time to waste.[AN]
Pilar, where did that griffin fly?[A]

To the east.[AN]
The Rebels have some[N]

Not much of a secret.[AN]
It's the only other point[N]

It's the only other point[N]

For the record, I still[N]

You[Beat] you may somehow[N]

Are you saying you[N]

Yes[Beat] I am.[AN]

[CloseEyes]This town has no place for me.[AN]
It never did.[AN]

Can you fight?[A]
[ML][2LB]
I am no soldier, but[N]
with a knife[Beat] I can try.[AN]
And, perhaps, provide aid and[N]
comfort outside of the fray[Beat][AN]
for such is always what[N]
I have been better at.[A]

Last thing I heard, you[N]

[Beat][CloseEyes]Lady Magdalena did[N]
not deserve this death.[AN]
Neither did Father Gavriel,[N]

They were no fighters,[N]

Let it be all those with[N]

We're under attack.[AN]
That pirate captain[N]
you mentioned in town[Beat][AN]

But why would they come after us?[AN]

Unless[Beat] those saddlebags[Beat][A]

Er[Beat][A]

did you steal the damn supplies?!?[AN]
If there's one thing[N]
that makes pirates mad,[AN]
it's stealing from them![A]

Look, we need food too![AN]
There's not much to forage[N]
out here in the woods![A]

Ugh[Beat][AN]
If we both survive this, I'll[N]
have a lecture or two to give.[AN]
For now? We have to fight.[A]

everything is accounted for.[A]

And the rebels had some[N]
extra goods stashed here, too.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]They won't be needin' 'em anymore.[ToggleSmile][A]

That's a relief. It looks like[N]
they're all dead or fled[Beat][A]

Should we chase 'em, boss?[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]No. We've wasted too much[N]

useful things out of it.[A]

Speak for yourself.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Bashin' a few of those[N]
self-righteous morons is[N]
always worth doin' to me.[A]
[L][2LB][ToggleSmile]
These were no real members[N]
of a Rebel movement[Beat][AN]
Just a pack of local pirates[N]
pretending to a higher cause.[A]
[FL]
Yeah, that's what the[N]
whole rebellion is, Pilar.[A]
[L]
As someone who's fought[N]
them before, as you claim,[AN]
surely you see the[N]
difference between-[A]

This place was halfway to[N]
crumbling even before we[N]
shook it with the fighting[Beat][AN]

It holds no true[N]

On that, we agree,[N]
although my past was here.[AN]
If you are looking to leave,[AN]
perhaps we could join that[N]

[ML]
[Beat]No.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Every faction that[N]
lays claim to the sky[Beat][AN]
Incendivis, the Rebels, and[N]

Yes[Beat] I have no desire to hold[N]
back my people any longer than I have.[AN]

I'm not the healer[N]
Father Gavriel was,[AN]

important member of the crew.[AN]
And your advice holds a bit more[N]
merit than you think it does.[AN]
Just[Beat] be more[N]
careful, in the future.[AN]
Think about the risks[N]
you're asking us all to take.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat][OpenEyes]I will.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you, Captain Lua[Beat][N]
for forgiving me despite this.[A][X]

[Beat][CloseEyes]Years ago, I arrived at[N]
Port Receloso with nothing[N]
but the clothes on my back[Beat][AN]
with my life, and my family,[N]
all left behind to burn.[AN]
I spent all this time[N]
giving this town everything[N]
I had left to give[Beat][AN]
and now there is[N]
nothing left here.[AN]
[Beat]Nothing, but the[N]
prospect of a new life.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Goodbye, Port Receloso.[N]
I will not miss you.[A][CSS]

[ML][2LB]
Hey, you! Thief lady![AN]
We're about to set sail.[N]
Are you ready to go?[A]
[MR][1LB]

[Beat]Avocado. The[N]
retiree from town.[AN]
I see you trying[N]
to climb aboard.[A]
[MR]
Aye[Beat] I am.[AN]
Captain Lua[Beat] allowed me to[N]
join your crew for good.[A]
[ML]
The chaos of the fight in[N]
the ruins is one thing,[AN]
but letting you[N]
aboard our ship?[AN]
Really?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]I am not tied down to[N]
T.O.R.C.H. anymore, as you may fear.[AN]
If I am destined to fight[Beat][AN]
let it be for a[N]
cause of my choosing,[AN]
rather than slavish loyalty[N]
to Incendivis's cruel campaign.[A]
[ML]
[ToggleSmile]The Empire's cruelty? Well,[N]
you're right about that much.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]I suppose if Lua trusted[N]
you to fight with us already,[AN]
then I'd best do the same.[AN]
Don't try anything stupid, Avocado.[A]
[MR]
My foolish mistakes[N]
occurred a long time ago[Beat][AN]
they can only be erased[N]
by fighting at your side.[A][X]
