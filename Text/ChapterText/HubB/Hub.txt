## HubB_BeginningScene_1_1
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
Free and clear, at least for now[Beat][N]
Desiderio, care for another wager?[AN]
I brought my cards with me, and we've[N]
got a bit of time until our next stop.[A]
[ML]
I'm not fool enough to be fleeced twice.[AN]
Besides, we're not even close to safe,[N]
not with that woman hunting us down.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Relax. We took the only ship on hand,[N]
and there's just as many traps[N]
ready for them on the way out.[AN]
Pitfalls, spearwalls, fireballs[Beat][AN]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]You're a nasty piece of work, boss.[N]
The hunted's really the hunter, huh?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well, I wouldn't go that far.[N]
Elodia would've never gained notoriety[N]
if obstacles like that would work.[AN]
But it'll buy us time, time enough[N]
to pay Port Greagor one last visit.[AN]
I've got a vessel there to reclaim.[A]
[ML]
That bloated boat? Fair enough.[N]
Not like Orlando'll take it off[N]
our hands, since he's one of us.[AN]
[MR]
And we'll need it if our crew gets[N]
any larger. Speaking of, can you[N]
send a signal to that old coot?[AN]
He can keep an eye out for TORCH[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Sure, but[Beat] you really trust him?[AN]
You two might go way back, but I've[N]
seen cleaner grime on a tavern floor.[AN]
[MR]
Grime comes with the territory;[N]
no successful merchant is fully moral.[AN]
That said, the man's helped me through[N]
hard times, long ago and even now.[AN]
If there's anyone I trust, it's him.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, if he's good enough for you,[N]
then he's good enough for me.[AN]
And if he's not a very good watchman,[N]
at least Pilar'll have us covered.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. Reliable, as always[Beat][N]
Ah, there's the port now.[AN]
Let's make a quick landing![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_2
[ML][LoadIda]
[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
Well, looks like you finally showed up.[N]
Kept me waiting long enough, Lua.[AN]
[R]
Ida? What are you doing here,[N]
by my boat? Care to explain?[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Probably fixin' to take it for herself.[AN]
She wanted us outta here before TORCH[N]
came knocking, and now, they busted down[N]
our door. Who else gains from all of that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]If you're trying to accuse me[N]
of calling Incendivis's hunting dogs,[N]
then you're dumber than I thought.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
You want a brawl that bad?[N]
All you had to do was ask![AN]
[R][3LB]
Desiderio, cool it![AN]
There's no proof that someone who's[N]
helped us all this time would turn,[N]
right? Take a step back and think.[AN]
We've made plenty of enemies who'd[N]
relish a chance to take us down.[A]
[FR][2LB]
[Beat]Pah. Fine, I'll shut it.[AN]
We've got no time to waste, anyway.[N]
Let's just get this thing flying.[AN]
[ML]
If that's what you want, you should[N]
be thanking me. It's already running.[AN]
[R]
Really? My thanks, but[Beat][N]
How did you know we were coming?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I didn't, but some suspicious characters[N]
kept roving around the port. Pirates,[N]
I'd bet, but no flags to prove it.[AN]
One of my men told me as much,[N]
and that it kept getting worse,[N]
so I came down and chased them off.[AN]
Made me figure something was coming[N]
for your crew, so I did you a favor,[N]
figuring you wouldn't leave the ship.[AN]
Call it a reward for being a good[N]
customer. And as I say that[Beat][N]
Where's Rahel? She was with you.[A]
[R][2LB]
She's safe, just below board.[N]
Rahel! Ida's here![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_3
[ML][LoadIda]
[MR][LoadRahel]
[ML]
So[Beat] that's the situation, is it?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
I'm[Beat] I'm sorry, Master Ida.[AN]
The moment my horse came running to me,[N]
and their commanders saw me there[Beat][AN]
Between reasoning with TORCH[N]
and fighting my way out of there,[N]
I took my chances with the second one.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Here's a better option: stay out of it.[AN]
Not like the captain was relying on you,[N]
girl. You're not much of a fighter.[AN]
[MR]
'Course, but I[Beat] I couldn't run.[AN]
They'd seen me already, so hiding[N]
wouldn't have done any good.[N]
[Beat]What should I do, Master Ida?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll have a bounty drawn up soon,[N]
I'm sure, so you can't stay here.[AN]
Ha! A girl like you, with doubloons[N]
on her head[Beat] All for surviving,[N]
in a bad position that I put you in.[AN]
It shouldn't have come to that.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes][1LB]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
Well, here's your reward, at least.[AN]
Those doubloons should last you[N]
a while, if you're frugal.[N]
[Beat]As for what you should do?[AN]
You can make your own decisions,[N]
but if you've got no other plans,[N]
then why not join Lua's crew?[AN]
[MR][OpenEyes][2LB]
But[Beat] but that doesn't make sense![AN]
All this time, I've been training[N]
to become like you, Master Ida![AN]
And now, you're saying I should[N]
go follow a damned pirate?[AN]
After everything I've learned?[N]
With all I have left to do here?![AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Listen to me, because I'll only[N]
say it once. You'll never be me.[AN]
As long as you're chasing my shadow,[N]
following me like a baby chick,[N]
you'll never even get close.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
But I[Beat] I still have so much to repay[N]
you for. I can't just leave, can I?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Whatever you think you owe me,[N]
save it. I took you in because[N]
you had nowhere else to go,[AN]
not because I expected a return.[AN]
[Beat]There's a wide world in these skies,[N]
one you haven't seen a bit of.[AN]
Find your own dream out there,[N]
instead of chasing after mine.[AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] Fine![A] If you don't want me here,[N]
then I'm gone. There's nothing for me[N]
in this shoddy port, anyway![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_4
[ML][LoadIda][3LB]
Maybe I was too hard on her.[N]
She needed to hear it, but[Beat][N]
It's tough seeing her tear up.[AN][MR][LoadLua][ML]
[Beat]Lua, what do you want?[N]
You should be ready to go.[A]
[MR][LoadLua]
I just wanted to say thanks,[N]
for everything you've done these[N]
past few months to help my crew.[AN]
I'm not sure that I can ever pay[N]
it back to you, but I'll try.[N]
If there's anything I can do, then-[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Yeah. There is one thing you can do,[N]
that only you can do for me, Lua.[AN]
Rahel[Beat] I got her into this mess,[N]
and I need you to keep her safe[N]
til it all blows over, alright?[AN]
If you do that, then we're square.[N]
I'm[Beat] I'm counting on you.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]Of course, Ida.[N]
I won't let you down.[AN]
You'll see her again,[N]
on my word as her captain![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_5
[ML][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
[Beat]What do you want?[AN]
[MR]
Just checking in on you.[AN]
You're part of my crew now,[N]
so it's kind of my job.[AN]
[ML]
Whatever.[N]
Are we leaving or not?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]Look, Rahel. I know you feel[N]
like you've lost a lot today,[N]
and you lashed out back there.[AN]
But don't let those be the last[N]
words you say to Ida, hear me?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
What? That's none of your business.[N]
I can say whatever I want.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Yes, but you'd better be willing[N]
to live with it, no matter what.[AN]
[Beat]As a kid, I bounced around orphanages,[N]
never staying at one for very long,[N]
so I never cared about someone like that.[AN]
But if I did, I wouldn't want this to[N]
be the last memory I had of them.[AN]
[Beat]Well, we're taking off right now,[N]
so whatever you decide, make it quick.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat] [Beat][N]
Damn it, I hope she doesn't hear me.[AN][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_6
[FR][LoadRahel]
Master Ida![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadIda]
Rahel? I thought you were setting sail.[N]
Are you sure you have time for this?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FR][LoadRahel]
O-Of course I do![N]
I[Beat] I[Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadIda][3LB]
[Beat]Keep your feet steady, alright?[N]
You've got to watch out for yourself,[N]
now. I won't be there to do it for you.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FR][LoadRahel]
I know that! I[Beat] I wanted to thank you.[N]
I'd be dead in a ditch without you[N]
taking me under your wing, Master Ida.[AN]
If you won't let me repay you,[N]
then all I can do is make you proud.[AN]
[Beat]That's all I wanted to say.[N]
Goodbye, Master Ida[Beat][N]
I'll never forget you![A][CSSCF][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_2_1
[L][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]
Ah, Pilar.[N]
How do the skies look?[AN]
[L]
Free of pursuers.[AN]
[MR]
Excellent. Anything else to report?[N]
Good news, bad news, any news.[AN]
The peace is putting me on edge.[A]
[L]
Well[Beat] There is one thing.[N]
Come in, stowaway. You're wanted.[AN]
[FL][LoadPonte]
Oh boy, I am?[N]
I'm not used to this![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Stowaway?[N]
Wait, from which boat?[AN]
[L]
The merchant ship. I found him[N]
hiding, poorly, behind a barrel.[AN]
[MR]
Well, out with it before[N]
I throw you overboard.[AN]
What's your business on my ship?[AN]
[FL]
Y-Yes, ma'am! The name's Ponte,[N]
and I wanna join your crew![AN]
I'm a real good carpenter,[N]
even better than Rahel![AN]
[MR]
I don't necessarily doubt you, but[Beat][N]
Are you carrying a massive ladder?[AN]
First, how, and more importantly, why?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Hm? Well, I've always been built[N]
like a sky ox! And I figure,[N]
it's real nice to have a path.[AN]
I can make this and put it down[N]
anywhere, long as I'm paid for it![AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] suppose I can see use in that,[N]
but what about your character?[AN]
Why do you want to become a pirate?[AN]
[FL]
Er, well[Beat] To tell ya the truth,[N]
I've got a rough background.[AN]
Piratin' ain't much to me,[N]
compared to where I've been.[AN]
But Master Ida saw somethin'[N]
in me and took me under her wing![AN]
I thought I'd be the next big shipwright[N]
'round port, but she told me that[N]
y'all were looking for more help.[AN]
Also, that you had a lotta gold[Beat][N]
So here I am! What's our next stop?[AN]
[MR][ToggleMouthMove]
(Damn it, Ida. I only signed up[N]
to do one favor, not two!)[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Hm[Beat] You seem like an unimpressive[N]
fighter, but your[Beat] unique set[N]
of skills may prove useful to us.[AN]
I'll pay you resource costs for any[N]
services done, but the bulk of your[N]
payment will have to wait, Ponte.[AN]
I'm expecting a great windfall,[N]
waiting for us at the world's end.[AN]
A vast collection of treasure rests[N]
there, beyond any of our imagination[Beat][N]
And you'll get the first cut, Ponte.[AN]
[FL]
Wow, really? That's real kind of you.[N]
I agree to your terms, Captain Lua![AN]
It's a pleasure doin' business with ya![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_2_2
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
What a sap[Beat] The world's end?[AN]
He'll never see that fortune[N]
in this lifetime. Clever, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat][N]
[Beat][AN][Event]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]So you actually mean what you said?[AN]
You plan on sailing into uncharted[N]
lands, and you kept that to yourself?[AN]
[MR]
You make it sound like I meant[N]
to keep a secret from the crew.[AN]
I meant to tell everyone else sooner,[N]
but with everything going on recently,[N]
we had bigger problems to worry about.[AN]
[ML]
With all due respect, let us decide[N]
which issue weighs more heavily.[AN]
Especially if it means that we[N]
must venture into the Old World,[N]
where maps cannot protect us.[AN]
[MR]
You know, for someone giving me grief[N]
about my secrets, you're hiding plenty[N]
of them yourself. The [OQ]Old World[CQ][Beat][AN]
I've never heard anyone call the lands[N]
uncharted on any map by that name.[N]
Where did you happen upon it, Pilar?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
In my youth, I too wished[N]
to escape Incendivis's reaches.[AN]
Not for treasure, like you,[N]
but for freedom from its grip.[AN]
That term[Beat] I learned it there.[A]
[MR]
Then why did you come back?[AN]
Surely you found what you[N]
were looking for there.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Perhaps. Regardless,[N]
the decision is yours to make.[AN]
But if you wish to succeed in whatever[N]
it is that you chase, listen well:[AN]
do not venture into the Old World[N]
with a half-hearted resolve,[N]
or this crew will pay for it.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Of course, Pilar.[N]
Speaking of, can you gather[N]
the rest of the crew for me?[AN]
I'll[Beat] I'll tell them my goals,[N]
and they can decide whether to stick[N]
around. Ah, that includes you, too.[AN]
[ML]
Relax, I have no intent to leave.[N]
I've grown[Beat] fond, of this crew,[N]
and our journeys across the sky.[AN]
Besides, you need my knowledge[N]
more than anyone else's here,[N]
if we're heading into the Old World.[AN]
[MR]
I'm glad to hear it, Pilar.[N]
[Beat]Everyone else feels the same,[N]
I'm sure. We all rely on you.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Well, I'm not growing any younger,[N]
so you should lean on me a bit less.[AN]
Still, I appreciate the sentiment.[N]
I[Beat] rely on all of you, too.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, good talk.[N]
I'll be going now.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR]
Pilar's capable of embarrassment?[AN]
I just keep learning new things today,[N]
ha! I'll have to write this one down[Beat][A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_1
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Looks like everyone's finally made it.[N]
Good news: There's no sign of TORCH,[N]
so we should be in the clear for now.[AN]
Clear enough to decide on a new path.[N]
My vote is to continue flying[N]
deeper into the outskirts,[AN]
but I'd like to hear more thoughts[N]
before I explain my goals here.[AN]
Would anyone like to start?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadRazvan]
I can begin the discussion, Captain Lua.[N]
In my view, our daring escape from[N]
Port Greagor leaves us little choice.[AN]
We'll have bounties on our heads,[N]
and, if we turn around, Imperial[N]
Marines eager to hunt them.[AN]
But if we stay in the outskirts and keep[N]
our heads down, our bounties won't rise.[AN]
Speaking from experience, Incendivis[N]
presence here is minimal, and laws lack[N]
enforcement. Pirates rove each port[Beat][AN]
Ugh, it makes me sick thinking of it.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Too bad. Sounds like heaven to me![AN]
But from my time in the Roseblades,[N]
there're more empire-hating goons out[N]
here, tryin' to make their own country.[AN]
I've got a score to settle with[N]
one of 'em, and if they're anywhere,[N]
this is where I'll find the bastard.[AN]
So yeah, I've got plenty of reason[N]
to stick around. Count me in, boss![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadPilar]
[Beat]I also have no objections, Lua.[N]
However, Razvan is only correct[N]
under normal circumstances.[AN]
TORCH likely hasn't stopped[N]
searching for us.[A] The Imperial[N]
Marines, with ships of supplies,[N]
head the same direction we do.[AN]
We won't truly be free of their[N]
reach unless we go even further,[N]
into the skies unknown to man.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR][LoadLua]
Pilar makes an important point.[AN]
There's been a clear increase[N]
in empire activity in the outskirts,[N]
with plenty of supplies. My guess?[AN]
They're searching for something[N]
out here, something of value.[N]
I don't know what it is, exactly.[AN]
It could be a hoard of gold,[N]
or priceless artifacts,[N]
or even the Fire Emblem![AN]
What I know, though, is that I want[N]
to snatch it right under their noses,[N]
and that's exactly what I intend to do.[AN]
There's a possibility that this could[N]
lead us into currently uncharted lands,[N]
with all the danger that implies[Beat][AN]
If the rest of you have something[N]
to say, speak up. Now's the time.[A][X]

// Scene 3
// Each of the crew collected so far say their piece; Orlando and Rahel start, the rest of the crew (if alive).

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_2_Orlando
[ML][LoadOrlando][3LB]
Well, you know my thoughts already, Lua.[N]
I fully support this venture,[N]
both with my heart and my coinpurse.[AN]
I have a wide array of basic goods[N]
for purchase at the fairest of prices,[N]
should the crew have any need for it.[AN]
My grace may make my profits plummet,[N]
but your gratitude is payment enough[Beat][N]
For now. I'll expect restitution later.[A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_2_Rahel
[ML][LoadRahel]
If we're going in somewhere blind,[N]
then our airships better be up to par.[AN]
I'll do a sweep around the new ones[N]
and report any flaws that I see.[AN]
You better not balk at the bill,[N]
captain. Safety doesn't come cheap.[A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_3
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Ha! I[Beat] I have to say, I expected[N]
at least one of you to want out.[AN]
But if not, that matter's settled![AN]
Now that we have a united goal,[N]
we're not just a band tied together[N]
by convenience. We're a crew![AN]
And a proper crew deserves a proper name.[AN]
A name that represents who we are,[N]
a band of pirates flying across[N]
the sky for treasure and adventure.[AN]
From today on, we're the Skysabers![AN]
[Beat]I'm not the creative type,[N]
but hopefully, this'll do.[AN]
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Not bad at all, boss.[N]
It's no Roseblades,[N]
but it'll do just fine![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR]
Ahem[Beat] With that done, let's get[N]
to the fun part. The privateer who[N]
owned this boat was a careful sort[Beat][AN]
He had enough food stores in here[N]
to last a fortnight, or longer![AN]
But he's got no need for them anymore,[N]
and we're finally in safe skies.[N]
Let's put them to good use, shall we?[AN]
It's time for a feast to celebrate[N]
our freedom, our friends, and our future![AN]
Don't leave a single plate[N]
unfinished, you hear me?[AN]
And tonight's a special occasion,[N]
so you can drink as much as you like![AN]
I'll handle the ship's navigation,[N]
so let's ring in our new crew[N]
with a night we'll never forget![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_4
[ML][LoadPilar][3LB]
So you have it handled, Lua?[N]
Maybe I'll unwind a bit,[N]
just this once[Beat][AN][X]


## HubB_BeginningScene_3_5
[ML][LoadRazvan][3LB]
If I'm to be among pirates, then[N]
I may as well celebrate like one.[N]
Three cheers for Captain Lua![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_6
Captain Lua![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_7
CAPTAIN LUA![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_4_1
A few days later...[X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_4_2
[MidRight][LoadLuaHatless][ToggleMouthMove]
(Ahhhh... It feels like the post-feast[N]
hangover has finally worn off for me.[AN]
And hopefully, the actual hangovers[N]
have faded away for the others, too.[AN]
It's about time to begin scouting[N]
for any points of interest out here.[AN]
I doubt we'll find any Fire Emblem[N]
while we're still in charted lands,[AN]
but I'll go ask around and see if[N]
anyone's seen something interesting.)[A][X]

[ML][LoadRazvan]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR][3LB]
Hey, Razvan. You've been looking[N]
awfully hard at the horizon,[N]
haven't you? See anything you like?[AN]
[ML]
W-What? Oh, no, I[Beat] It's not that.[N]
The course that you've set for us[N]
just takes me back a bit, is all.[AN]
My hometown is fairly close,[N]
and it's been quite a while[N]
since I left it to join the marines.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Do you want us to take you there?[N]
If you're homesick, I don't mind[N]
stopping there for a day or two.[AN]
[ML]
No, I couldn't ask that of you.[N]
Besides, I'm not sure that I'm ready[N]
to return, not as things are now.[AN]
That said, if you're looking for[N]
opportunities, there's one close[N]
by that may interest you, captain.[AN]
My home rests near an oasis in the[N]
Taklakama Desert, surrounded by[N]
endless sands and deadly heat.[AN]
My mother always warned me about[N]
leaving the village, so I listened.[AN]
But others whispered of a desert ruin[N]
out in those dunes, filled with riches[N]
and weapons that could be of use to us.[AN]
My memories are vague on the details,[N]
but the rumors were loud enough that[N]
there may be some truth to them.[A]
[MR]
So it's a bit of a gamble?[N]
Still, I do enjoy a good[N]
adventure. What to do[Beat][A][X]

## HubB1Accepted
[ML][LoadRazvan]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Sure, why not? Let's go, Razvan.[AN]
It may not be worth our while,[N]
but I'm just glad you're taking[N]
interest in something pirate-y.[AN]
[ML]
W-Well, I wouldn't say that[Beat][AN]
But I'll admit that I've always[N]
been curious about the secrets[N]
hidden within Taklakama's sands.[AN]
[MR]
Well, no matter what happens,[N]
you'll have your answers soon.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Time for some treasure hunting![A][X]

## HubB1Rejected
[ML][LoadRazvan]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Sorry, Razvan, but we've got higher[N]
priorities right now. We can come back[N]
later, though, if you still want to.[AN]
[ML]
Yes, I'd like that, captain.[N]
Better this than some other piracy[N]
that our crew might suggest[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Heh[Beat] You're still too good a kid[N]
for this life, Razvan. I appreciate it,[N]
you know: you sticking by me anyway.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]Think nothing of it, captain.[N]
So long as my debt remains unpaid,[N]
I'll always have your back![A][X]

## HubB2Pitch
[ML][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML][1LB]
Captain Lua. Do you have a moment?[A]
[MR][2LB]
We've no shortage of time[N]
out here, Rahel. Say your piece.[A]
[ML][3LB]
With how big our crew has gotten,[N]
our supplies just can't keep up.[AN]
I know Pilar has a plan[N]
to get us some fresh water,[AN]
but all the water in the sky[N]
can't take the place of a[N]
hearty meal or a secure hull.[A]
[MR][2LB]
That's a problem, all right.[AN]
And with our scale, we'll need to[N]
find a proper port to restock[Beat][AN]
but out here?[A]

Boss, you got a minute to talk?[AN]
I've got a destination for the crew[N]
in mind, if you'll take requests.[AN]
[MR]
You'd know more about these[N]
parts than me, so shoot.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Right[Beat] Well, this little island[N]
here's called Snowthorne, y'see.[AN]
The name comes from what you'd guess.[N]
Never seen the place with less than[N]
six inches of snow on the ground.[AN]
But yeah, my old crew, the Roseblades,[N]
used to hang around an old fort here.[AN]
[Beat]It all went to hell when TORCH[N]
showed up, off a tip given by a traitor[N]
in the crew. I've mentioned this, right?[A]
[MR][2LB]
You have. Where's this going,[N]
and how does it benefit us?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
You'd see where it's goin'[N]
if you let me finish, boss.[N]
After the attack, they left real quick.[AN]
Probably didn't want to hang around[N]
in the cold and risk us striking back.[AN]
I hung around for a little, along with[N]
a couple other survivors from our crew.[AN]
But they all left, one by one, til[N]
it was me and one other guy[Beat][N]
Wouldn't be surprised if he stayed.[AN]
Anyway, we had a huge stockpile[N]
of fuel, what with the cold weather.[AN]
That fuel can be used for airships,[N]
and if we're going into the unknown,[N]
we need as much as we can get.[AN]
I say we swing by there and grab[N]
it for ourselves, if you're up for it.[A]
[MR]
That does sound tempting, Desiderio.[N]
But what of that man? You don't think[N]
he could have taken the rest and ran?[AN]
[ML]
Nah, no way. If he's got anything,[N]
it's a sense of honor[Beat] of duty.[N]
He'll still be there, I'm sure.[AN]
And if he's not, no one else would[N]
find the fuel. We've got it locked up,[N]
and only he and I know how to get it.[AN]
So long as he doesn't put up a fight,[N]
it'll be free to take for ourselves.[N]

Either way, they don't mean well.[A]

On that note. I have a[N]

Perhaps we could take a trip to that[N]

I wouldn't say that, Desi[Beat][N]
Apologies, captain. I meant[N]

Man, you really haven't changed[N]
at all, Ernest. Too damn stiff,[N]

Leandra[Beat] Even when you're right,[N]
somehow, you still rub me the wrong[N]

You three are getting on well.[N]
I figured you would, given you[N]
all were in the same crew, but[Beat][AN]
Well, it's nice to see it, anyway.[A]

It's all thanks to you, boss.[AN]
Sure, things ain't ever gonna be[N]

Not really. I was just curious[N]

the two of you left the crew yet?[AN]
TORCH is hunting us as we speak.[AN]
If you care that much about your[N]

Well, it's just strange, isn't it?[AN]

You doubting us, Captain Lua?[N]
You think we're some kind of[N]

I never said that, now did I?[N]
You two haven't shown any signs.[AN]
And if you did, then trust me:[N]
I would've thrown you to the[N]

[FarLeft]
[Beat]Scary as shit, as usual. Fine,[N]
I'll tell you why I'm still here.[AN]
Leonor's probably got her own reasons,[N]
but to me, staying as one of your crew[N]
just means that we'll fight TORCH again.[AN]
And I can't think of a better way to[N]
cut the empire down a peg than taking[N]
out some of those bastards, heh![AN]
[Left]
As for me[Beat] I'll be honest, captain.[N]
I don't view myself as much of a rebel.[N]
Sure, I had Jaime's passion, once[Beat][AN]
But rebel groups these days? Each one[N]
has different ideals. They squabble.[N]
And their lack of unity dooms them.[AN]
So taking a break for a bit seemed[Beat][N]
Wise. Being a pirate isn't so bad,[N]
either. So, here I am, at your service.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, so long as you both want[N]

I am fine, captain.[N]
None of this is new to me.[N]

Ah, right. You mentioned that[N]
you were a pirate in the past.[N]
What made you retire to the forest?[AN]

I became tired of a pirate's life.[AN]
The looting, the swashbuckling[Beat][N]
It excited me as a younger man,[N]
but soon enough, I became hollow.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Hollow?[N]
In what way?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
My crew was not as tight-knit as yours.[N]
We did as our captain asked, took the[N]
spoils, and wasted them just as quickly.[AN]
[Beat]Soon enough, I wondered why[N]
I continued to loot and pillage.[N]
What was I working toward?[AN]
[Beat]I found no answer to my question.[N]
And so, I went to as remote an area[N]
as I could, to leave my life behind.[AN]
To find something new in the silence.[AN]

But you came back to the fold, anyway?[N]
[Beat]Well, I hope that things are different[N]
this time for you, Neltume. Truly.[AN]

Captain! I[Beat] I just can't get enough[N]

Remembering all the places we've seen,[N]

Ha! You're in better spirits than[N]

not bother you? Not even a little bit?[AN]

Sure, dying doesn't sound great[Beat][N]
But the whole world's our oyster,[N]
now that we're here in the outskirts![AN]
And that's what I always dreamed of,[N]
back when I worked as a clerk[N]

So I'm looking on the bright side.[AN]
And hey, we might get to see sights[N]
that nobody's ever seen before soon,[N]

Huh, you two are an unlikely pair[Beat][N]
I guess you finally found out that[N]
Durgham was one of us, Orlando.[AN]
[Left]
He hid from me surprisingly well[Beat][N]
But then, I saw a glimpse of him[N]
during our battle with TORCH.[AN]
The rest, as they say, is history.[A]
[MidRight]
What [OQ]rest[CQ] are you talking about,[N]
exactly? Don't forget. Durgham's one of[N]
my crew now, so whatever past you have,[AN]
you'd better make sure that it doesn't[N]
interfere with his job here. Got it?[AN]
[Left]
Past? Oh, I barely know the man beyond[N]
the sum next to his name on my ledger.[N]
He owes me around 2000 gold, you see.[AN]

[Beat]That's it? Never mind. I'm taking[N]
back my sympathy for you, Durgham.[N]
Whatever Orlando decides goes.[AN]

C-Captain, how can you be so heartless?[N]
Surely you could at least convince[N]
Felicitas to reduce my debt a mere-[AN]

Not gonna happen[Beat] Although, if you'd[N]
like, I could buy off the debt from[N]
him. I do enjoy having debtors around[Beat][AN]
Ordering them to do things that make[N]
me laugh is one of my favorite pastimes.[AN]
[FarLeft]
D-Devil! What band of evildoers[N]
have I found myself falling into[Beat][N]
All because I bet on the wrong horse![AN]
If Greyrider had just went a little[N]
faster across the finish line, I'd[N]
be the richest man in Incendivis![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You borrowed money to gamble?[AN]
[Left]
Many such cases, unfortunately.[N]
Regardless, I'll have Durgham pay[N]
me back by carrying my wares around,[AN]
if he can't find any other way.[N]
Is that agreeable with you, captain?[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, seems fine. Boring, though[Beat][N]
You sure you don't want me to buy[N]
his debt from you, Orlando?[AN]
[FarLeft]
No, please don't! I-I'll do whatever[N]
you say, Felicitas! I just have one[Beat][N]
small request. Could I have 1000 gold-[AN]

No chance. Now, shall we be off?[AN]
We've plenty of time to sell my goods[N]

Damn it all[Beat] Can't get any peace around[N]

If Carmen takes a liking to you?[N]
Yeah, I guess so. Say, Carmen.[N]
If Fata doesn't like it, you should-[AN]

Hold on, captain. If I really want[N]

I might consider it, at least.[AN]

Heh[Beat] Well, seems like you're doing[N]
just fine, Fata. Just let me know if that[N]
ever changes, and I'll come running.[AN]

Everything that's happened, I guess.[AN]

Ah, you mean becoming fugitives?[N]
Certainly, that was more than[N]
I bargained for when I joined[Beat][AN]
But on the other hand, we certainly[N]

That's all I really wanted, captain.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You know, you never did say[N]
why you left the Incendivis army.[N]
I'm curious, so mind telling me?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sure, if you like. It's not much[N]
of a story, though. I didn't have[N]
anyone keeping me around, is all.[AN]
So when I saw how corrupt Incendivis[N]
could really be, nothing held me[N]
back from packing up and leaving.[AN]
[MidRight]
And what kind of corruption[N]
did you see, exactly?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]The usual, I guess.[N]
Like I said, it's really[N]
nothing interesting.[AN]
In any case, I like life[N]
here a lot better, captain.[N]
So thanks for having me on.[AN][CSSCF]

[Beat]Forget it. You're free to feel however[N]
you like, Avocado. But, a word of advice?[AN]
Punishing yourself like this[Beat][N]
Walking around like you're a dead man[Beat][N]
It doesn't do a damn thing for anyone.[AN][CSSCF]

Perhaps a bit[Beat] er[Beat] skysick[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
You sound surprised, somehow.[N]
Did you really never leave[N]
Receloso Island? Not even once?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Never. My parents had little money,[N]
so naturally, I never left town[N]
as a child. And as an adult[Beat][AN]
I've served Port Receloso for[N]
as long as I can remember,[N]
in one way or another.[AN]
Leaving there meant leaving[N]
behind my duty to my people[Beat][N]

You sound homesick, not skysick.[AN]
[Beat]You know, if we're ever close[N]
to port, I wouldn't mind flying[N]
by and letting you visit for a bit.[N]
[MidLeft]
I appreciate the offer, captain.[N]
But it's as I said to you before.[N]
I failed the people there as mayor.[AN] 
I don't deserve to go home, not now.[N]
[Beat]And more importantly, if I did,[N]
I'm not sure that I[Beat] that I could[Beat][AN]

Not until I've become worthy of them[N]

Oh? Why's that? You got something[N]
against pirates? Some dark past[N]
that you'd like to reveal?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, my past has nothing to do[N]
with piracy. That said, petty theft[N]
is different from what pirates do.[AN]
I wouldn't want to be known as a pirate.[N]
Normally, anyway. Your crew is[Beat][N]
different. Much more accepting.[AN]
[MidRight]
We're a broad sort. I wouldn't call[N]

But everyone's got to have a code.[AN]
Other pirates, like the Blackhearts[Beat][N]
They're the majority of our lot,[N]

Huh, really? You never told me[N]

work, too. I thought Passarola might be[N]
able to help me out with these, but[Beat][A]
[FarLeft]
Sorry, but I create out of love,[N]
not logic. I couldn't be less[N]
interested in Ximo's inventions![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Really? Even when they might[N]
save your hide in the next battle?[N]
You've really got a screw loose.[AN]
[Left]
It's fine. But say, Passarola.[N]
Would you at least let me watch[N]
as you work on your own things?[AN]
Maybe watching a great inventor[N]

on how to improve my gadgets.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
A-A great inventor? Heh, well,[N]
if you insist[Beat] Do as you wish![N]
A warning for you, though:[AN]
I don't intend to slow down,[N]

attention if you want to learn![A]

But[Beat] I've never been good with[N]

Heh[Beat] Yeah, I definitely can.[N]
It's too bad, but you've got[N]

I could never go flying around[Beat][N]
Think I'd get sick real quick.[N]
You're pretty brave, Razvan.[AN]

Thanks, but I wouldn't say that.[AN]
Pegasi tend to favor those with[N]

Who's this impression about?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh[Beat] Should I say it, Tang?[AN]
[Right]
You'd better not. You know how many[N]
times I saved you two back before[N]
we joined the captain's group?[AN]
[FarLeft]
But it would be really funny[Beat][N]
And besides, I saved you and[N]
Matteo way more times, y'know?[AN]
[Left]
Hey, hey! There's no way that's true.[N]
Without me, who'd be holding down the[N]
frontline so you can fire, Suzanne?[A]
[FarRight]
Hm[Beat] You two knew Tangyuan,[N]
before this? Were you a part[N]
of the same mercenary group?[AN]
[Right]
You could say that, yeah. Before you[N]
guys picked me up, I'd been lots of[N]
places searching for[Beat] adventure.[AN]
I ran into these two one of those times,[N]
and Matteo said they could use someone[N]
with my skills. Suzanne didn't much care.[AN]
[FarLeft]
C'mon, you're making me sound bad.[N]
I just thought that me and Matteo[N]
had it all handled, either way.[AN]
And I was right. Once you left us,[N]
I went back to doing all the work[N]
with Matteo as my meatshield.[AN]
[Left]
That's not how I remember it[Beat][N]
If you're gonna talk a big game,[N]
then you'd better back it up[N]
in the ring later, Suzanne.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Later? Why not right now, huh?[N]
I'm all for it. Been a while since[N]
I showed you who's boss, Matteo.[AN]
[Left]
Fine, then let's go! Captain, Tang,[N]
we're taking off. See you around![AN][CSSCF]
[FarLeft][CSSCF]
[Right]
[Beat]You can see why I left these[N]
two idiots. Still, a drink with[N]
them now and again isn't so bad.[AN]
[FarRight]
Right[Beat] So how's that search for[N]
adventure treating you, with us?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
You really need to ask? I'd bet most[N]
people, in their whole lives, won't[N]
do half of what we've done, so far.[AN]
As long as you keep things exciting[N]
and don't get on my ass, I'm with[N]
you til we fall to the Lands Below.[AN]
[FarRight]
Ha[Beat] I can't ask for more than that.[N]
Good talk, Tangyuan. I'll leave you[N]
to your drinks, but one last thing.[AN]
You want adventure? The Old World'll[N]
give us that, and a lot more, I bet.[N]
Just make sure you're ready for it.[A][CSSCF]
[Right]
Damn, not a bit of fear in those eyes![N]
She's one hell of a woman, after all.[AN]
[Beat]I'll have to work on my impression[N]
of the captain, or she might have my[N]
hide if Matteo and Suzanne fess up.[AN][X]

Huh[Beat] What are you two doing down here?[N]
Kind of an odd pair, if I'm honest.[AN]
[Left][3LB]
A-Ah, captain! It was, well[Beat][N]
I needed someone with muscle to help me[N]
with something that you asked me to do.[AN]
And Dmitr seemed to be doing nothing[N]
besides staring at the horizon,[N]
so I asked them for some aid.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I had nothing else to do, so why not?[N]
It seemed as if it would be helpful[N]
to the crew, as well. A win-win.[AN]
[MidRight]
But what are you doing, exactly?[N]
I can't think of anything that[N]
I assigned which requires strength[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Er[Beat] Didn't you mention that[N]
I should take inventory?[AN]
So someone needed to bring our stores[N]
down here, by my desk, so that I could[N]
look them over and list what we have.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Uh, couldn't you have just[N]
gone up there with a notepad[N]
and done the inventory yourself?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hrm[Beat] The captain has a point.[N]
I have no experience with matters[N]
of bookkeeping, but it sounds logical.[AN]
Did you merely want to save the effort[N]
of venturing around the armada, Yodsen?[A]
[Left]
W-What? No, no, that's not it![N]
I[Beat] Er[Beat] Well, perhaps I did.[N]
In any case, we're almost done, so-[A]
[FarLeft]
Indeed. I'll go grab the last box.[N]
But don't ask me to help you again,[N]
Yodsen. I have better things to do.[A][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Yeah, that's about what I expected.[N]
I don't know if this was your solution[N]
out of laziness or stupidity, Yodsen.[AN]
But either way, the rest of the crew[N]
won't respond as kindly as Dmitr did,[N]
if you try roping them into this.[AN]
And don't forget: I asked you to do it.[N]
So if I find out that you're relying[N]
on everybody else[Beat] You get me?[AN]
[Left]
Y-Yes, captain! I'm very sorry![AN]
I'll get off my butt and go[N]
finish the inventory myself,[N]
so please don't throw me overboard![A][CSSCF]

Well, that was an overreaction,[N]
but hopefully, I scared him straight.[N]

Ahead of your deadline, too.[N]
We're the best new recruits ever![N]

Do you really want praise for just[N]
doing your jobs[Beat] Well, good work.[N]
You two have really shaped up, recently.[A]

You've had us working together a lot,[N]

Right! Indio isn't very fast or strong,[N]
but they always try their best, and that[N]
motivates me to work harder, too.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Hey, did you just insult me?[AN]
[Left]
And their stories about the world[N]
are always so interesting, too![AN]
Before I joined your crew, captain,[N]
I never got to see much of it myself[Beat][N]
But Indio's seen so much of the skies.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, right. I guess you did mention[N]
that you were some kind of vagrant.[N]
Don't lie to her too much, okay?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hey, hey, can you two stop slandering me?[N]
I weave all of my tales from the fabric[N]
of my heart[Beat] I would never lie. Ever![AN]
[Left]
Then[Beat] Do you think it's possible[N]
to fly up to the stars, Indio?[N]
That's always been my dream.[AN]
I hoped that we might find an island[N]
in the outskirts that has similar[N]
conditions, at least, but[Beat][AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Yeah, I think that it's possible.[N]
I've seen a lot of strange things[N]
in this world, so what's one more?[AN]
But flying up to the stars, huh[Beat][N]
Wow, that would be a crazy story![N]
I'd love to try going, myself.[A]

S-Someone else finally understands me[Beat][AN]
I knew you were a kindred spirit, Indio![N]

let's try to figure out how to go there![A][CSSCF]

W-Wait, Estelle! Wait a second![N]
I can't keep up with you![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Heh, so she found someone else[N]
that believes in her dream, did she?[N]
It was right to pair them up, then.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's mid-day, Biko. Why would any[N]
of you be getting dessert now?[AN]
Besides, all of the meals that[N]
I cook have nutritional value.[N]
Sugary sweets don't fall under that.[AN]
[Left]
That's what I told him, captain[Beat][N]
Do you know that he's spending[N]
most of his pay on fruit jams?[AN]
I keep telling him that he needs[N]

it on our own one day, but he-[AN]
[FarLeft]
Oh, come on, Ondeh! You don't need[N]
to harp on me in front of the[N]

Apparently, I do! If you won't listen[N]
to me, then maybe the captain can talk[N]
some sense into you. Please, captain?[AN]
[MidRight]
What am I supposed to be, your mom?[N]
If Biko wants to spend his hard-earned[N]
doubloons on sweet treats, so be it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Ha ha, the captain took my side![AN]
[MidRight]
No, I definitely did not. Your sister's[N]
right that you should spend your gold[N]
more cautiously than you are, Biko.[AN]
My point was only that it's your choice[N]
to make, and you should make it freely[Beat][N]
As long as you suffer the consequences.[AN]
[FarLeft]
H-Huh? What's that mean, captain?[N]
I don't like the sound of it[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
What it means is this. If Ondeh ever[N]
saves enough gold to leave my employ,[AN]
then she shouldn't spend a single[N]
doubloon trying to bring you with her.[N]
But I'd bet that she would, right?[AN]
[Left]
O-Of course I would. Biko's still[N]
my brother. I couldn't just leave[N]
him here, all alone in the world.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Y-Yeah, we're siblings![N]
We always watch out for[N]
each other, no matter what![AN]
[MidRight]
But if you keep spending like you are,[N]
then you're only holding Ondeh back.[AN]
She'll have to stay here and work[N]
twice as hard to make up for your[N]
selfishness. How is that fair?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I[Beat] I guess it isn't. I didn't think[N]
about it that way. Ondeh, do you[Beat][N]
Do you really want to leave?[AN]
[Left]
Huh? I mean, no, not right now.[N]
I like it here, and I like the[N]
captain. But yeah, one day[Beat][AN]
One day, I'd like to retire[N]
to some rural island and hunt[N]
game for my living, instead.[AN]
It sounds[Beat] really peaceful.[N]
More my speed than being a pirate.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Me, I wouldn't mind flying[N]
around with everyone forever.[AN]
But I wouldn't want you to worry[N]
about me, and I wouldn't want to[N]
hold you back either, Ondeh.[AN]
So I'll try to cut down on the[N]
jams and save up for when we're[N]
ready to make our own way.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Thank you, Biko. And thank you,[N]
captain, for hearing us out about[N]
this[Beat] You're always so wise.[AN]
[MidRight]
When you say it like that, you make[N]
me sound a lot older than I like[Beat][N]
But you're very welcome, Ondeh.[AN]
And[Beat] I wouldn't mind making dessert[N]
for everyone, for special occasions.[AN]

Such evil brilliance! Such malicious wit![N]
Why, oh why, did I join this crew?[A][X]

## HubBArmadaExplanation
In the outskirts, Lua can speak with[N]
the crew in the armada by exploring[N]
the three ships that they now possess.[AN]
To go take on missions and progress[N]
through the hub, step on the green[N]
tile to venture through the outskirts.[AN]
Red tiles in the outskirts will take[N]
the crew to new chapters, just as[N]
red tiles in Port Gregor did.[A][X]

## HubBSayWhereToGo
Now that all missions in the outskirts[N]
have been completed, Lua can go rest[N]
in her room (2nd floor of the left ship).[N]
This will end Hub B, so make sure that[N]
the crew has nothing left to do[N]
before moving to the next chapter![A][X]
