[ML][3LB]
B-Boss! We about done runnin'?[N]
I'm really feelin' the burn![AN]
[MR]
Good. You could use a bit less[N]
fat on those bones, Rodri.[AN]
[ML]
Ah, c'mon! Ain't we run long enough?[N]
We got clear out of that impy fleet[N]
quick. They can't be that close![AN]
[MR]
Would you gamble all[AN]
of our lives on that?[AN]
[ML]
Er[Beat] No, but-[AN]
[MR]
We've run into enough trouble since[N]
we escaped T.O.R.C.H., as it is.[AN]
They just keep hounding us[Beat][N]
If we slow down now, the Blackhearts[N]
may become nothing more than a memory.[AN]
[ML]
Huh? Sure, the captain's ship went down,[N]
but you don't really think that Captain[N]
Alonso bit the dust, do ya? That's[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Crazy. No, I believe that he's alive.[N]
And if he is, then we have to find him[N]
and any of the other survivors, quickly.[AN]
The Old World isn't the one we know[Beat][N]
Stick around any longer, and even he'll[N]
run into trouble without the whole crew.[A]
[ML]
W-Well, can we at least raid that[N]
village, over there? It don't look[N]
too defended. And we could use food.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Food, or loot?[N]
Which are you after?[AN]
[ML]
Rumble in my stomach says food,[N]
the Blackhearts' code says loot[Beat][N]
Either way, I think it's a good idea.[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] It does look sparsely defended.[N]
And we're running low on weapons[Beat][N]
Alright, Rodri. We'll raid the town.[AN]
But don't waste any time having fun.[N]
Our getaway ship isn't getting anywhere,[N]
anymore, so we need to make this quick.[AN]
[ML]
Aye aye, boss![A][X]

// Calista and a group of Incendivis notice the situation and discuss what to do, with most not wanting to risk their necks to save rebels.

[FarRight][LoadValerie]
[ML]
[Beat]You heard it like I did,[N]
captain. The Blackhearts[N]
mean to raid that town.[AN]
We should head back to base,[N]
let Commander Elodia know,[N]
and make ready to wipe them out.[A]
[FR]
W-What about the town, though?[N]
There are people walking around.[N]
Kids. And the Blackhearts[Beat] They'll[Beat][AN]
[ML]
People? Maybe, but they aren't ours.[AN]
[R]
People are people, no matter what[N]
flag they fly. Or do you view those[N]
in the Old World as lesser? Subhuman?[AN]
[ML]
No, but I'm not laying my life on the[N]
line to save damned rebels, no matter[N]
how many suckling babes they've got.[AN]
[R]
I swore an oath to protect people.[N]
So did you. And you mean to watch[N]
as pirates slaughter innocents?[AN]
We can send one person to report[N]
the situation, but as for the rest-[AN]
[ML]
Pah! I swore an oath to protect[N]
Incendivis, not traitorous scum![AN]
You want to do it? Do it yourself.[N]
The rest of us'll go report to[N]
Commander Elodia, as ordered.[AN][X]

// Then, she sends Valerie off to warn the village while she acts as a decoy, for the time being, so that the people there can escape.

[ML]
[Beat]Good riddance.[A]
[MR][3LB]
C-Captain! I'm so sorry.[N]
If I hadn't spoken up,[N]
then maybe they would-[AN]
[ML]
You have no reason to apologize,[N]
Val. And no time for it, either.[AN]
I need you to go inform the villagers[N]
that a pirate attack is imminent.[N]
Meanwhile[Beat] I'll act as decoy.[AN]
[MR]
Captain Calista, you can't![AN]
I mean, there's so many of them.[N]
No matter how strong you are,[N]
you[Beat] you don't have a chance![AN]
[ML]
Ha! Come now, Val. Don't count[N]
me out before the battle's begun.[N]
We've survived worse, haven't we?[AN]
[MR]
Mm[Beat] I don't know about that.[N]
The Fairwind Corridor wasn't[N]
this bad, I don't think[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]We were saved by pirates, that day.[N]
Frankly, I've viewed myself as living[N]
on borrowed time ever since, Val.[AN]
So, even if I do fall here[Beat] If it[N]
means that a single family escapes[N]
the Blackhearts, then I've no complaints.[AN]
[Beat]Now, go. That's an order.[A]
[MR]
F-Fine! But I'll be back, captain![N]
So don't stop fighting til I am![A][X]

// Then, Calista confronts Salvador, successfully provokes some of the Blackhearts to follow her to a fort...

Well, well, well. The Blackhearts,[N]
in the flesh. Tired of running?[AN]
[R]
B-Boss! It's an impy![AN]
[FR]
I can see that myself, idiot.[N]
I told you that we'd have problems[N]
if we slowed down the pace here[Beat][AN]
[ML]
I could smell you all from leagues away,[N]
so honestly, stopping here or running[Beat][N]
It really wouldn't make a difference.[AN]
[R]
Hey, I bathe every damn day![AN]
[ML]
Could have fooled me, honestly.[A]
[R]
Grr[Beat] Fine, you want a fight that bad![N]
Then I'll give you one, you bitch![A]
[FR]
Damn it, Rodri! Don't fall for-[A][X]

// Even though the leader of the group tells them not to take the bait and is frustrated by their lack of discipline. Still, he tells everyone else to get that raid done before
// other imperials catch onto where the group is. (which will be a hard turn limit, maybe?)

## HubC_2_BeginningScene5
[MidRight][LoadSalvador][3LB]
[Beat]The bait. So much for a quick raid.[N]
Everyone else, don't follow Rodri's lead![N]
Focus on the town and tear it apart![AN]
And if anyone stands in your way[Beat][N]
Then tear them apart, too![AN][X]

// Then, we pan back to Calista, who prays to the Maker that she'll hold out long enough to secure the evacuation of the people here.

## HubC_2_BeginningScene6
[MidLeft][LoadCalista][3LB]
Huff[Beat] Looks like I pulled as many[N]
of their forces away as I could.[N]
Val[Beat] Good luck, and godspeed.[A][X]

// Then, we pan to the village and see Lua + Orlando haggling with the Keeper supplier, with them trying (and failing) to bring Pilar into it.

Look, I'm not negotiating down.[N]
Normally, we wouldn't even sell[N]
to you outsiders. You should be-[AN]
[R]
Grateful, when you're trying to rip[N]
us off? You're charging one and a half[N]
times the regular price, you thief![AN]
[ML]
Hmph. The value of building supplies[N]
is simply different, in the Old World.[AN]
We make little more than we need,[N]
and only the odd merchant ship[N]
sails here to let us restock.[AN]
So if you want our wares,[N]
then you must pay more.[N]
That is my final say on the matter.[A]
[FR]
Now, now. No need to rush to judgement,[N]
my good man. Surely you can bend just[N]
a bit to make such a lucrative sale, yes?[AN]
After all, we count ourselves boon[N]
companions of the esteemed Lady Pilar![N]
Does her name mean naught to you?[AN]
[ML]
Hmph. It means that you count yourselves[N]
friends to a woman too accustomed to the[N]
outside world. In my view, an apostate.[AN]
But she was quite close to the former[N]
chief, and helped raise the current[Beat][N]
I can offer you a 5% discount, perhaps.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Oh, you son of a-[A]
[FFR][LoadDesiderio]
We got trouble, boss![N]
C'mon, check out the gate![A]
[FR]
Hah[Beat] When is there not trouble?[A]

Never, these days[Beat] But we'd better[N]
check it out. You coming, scammer?[AN]

Of course. We've yet to seal the deal.[A][X]

Well, what are the chances?[N]
Hey, you. Keeper guy.[N]
Lay off the girl, will you?[AN]

I don't take orders from you,[N]

The girl can barely raise that bow[N]

What's got you pissing your pants?[AN]

Y-You! How dare you, pirate scum-[AN]

Enough, man! She speaks rudely,[N]

They wanna loot and raid the village.[AN]
Me and Captain Calista overheard them,[N]
but the other Incendivis soldiers with[N]

[R]
Huh? What's she up to, then?[AN]
[L]
She[Beat] She's trying to hold them[N]
off by herself, now, to buy time.[AN]

Curses[Beat] Of all the times to attack,[N]
now? We just sent half the men back to[N]
the village, so that we could restock[Beat][AN]
[FR]
Is that so? Well, what a conundrum![N]
If only a valorous band of warriors[N]
could come to this depot's rescue[Beat][AN]
[R]
Hm? Ah. Yes, yes. If only, Orlando.[N]
But you know, brave fighters don't[N]
come free. Nothing good does, yeah?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]What do you want, scoundrels?[AN]
[R]
Oh, nothing crazy. Just[Beat][N]
The right to buy your supplies,[N]
discounted at 50% the normal rate.[AN]
[FL]
50[Beat] You mean to extort our plight?!
[FR]
Oh, extort is such an ugly word[Beat][N]
Were you not the one who spoke[N]
of the value of a product, earlier?[AN]
It just so happens that, at this time,[N]
the value of stalwart depot defenders[N]
is higher than usual. We would be[Beat][AN]
remiss, not to adjust to that fact.[N]
Is that not so, oh captain of mine?[A]
[R]
Oh, it's so, alright.[N]
So, what's it going to be?[N]
Ready to seal the deal yet?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Blast. Fine, you have your deal.[N]

[Beat]Which one of you's supposed to[N]
be good, exactly? I couldn't tell.[AN]
[R]
Neither, but that's beside the point.[N]
You joining us in this battle, Valerie?[A]
[ML]
O-Of course! Captain Calista's in danger,[N]
so I can't sit back and leave it to you![N]
We[Beat] We are rescuing her, right?[AN]
[R]
We'll try our damnedest to, sure.[N]
But I can't make any promises.[AN]

From one pirate to another,[N]

Ha! Excellent work, captain.[N]
You've put the pirates to rout[N]
quite nicely. I'm impressed![AN]

Impressed enough to not back[N]
out of our deal, I hope?[N]
We did save your lives, after all.[AN]
[ML]
Ah, well[Beat] Yes, I won't renege[N]
on the deal. We Keepers have more[N]
honor than pirates, after all.[AN]

Indeed, indeed. Just so, my good man![N]
Now, would you mind escorting me[N]

What's the situation, captain?[AN]

The situation is that our pirate[N]

Take a look off into the horizon.[AN]
[ML]
That[Beat] That's an airship![N]
And a real one! Not some dinghy[N]
that can barely hold five dudes.[AN]
[R]
You think it'll work for us?[AN]
[ML]
Well, it definitely looks big enough.[N]
Can't fully say what the condition[N]
is til I get a little closer, but[Beat][AN]
It looks grounded. Not big repairs,[N]
I'd bet, but it won't fly for a bit.[AN]
[R]
Hm[Beat] Orlando![AN]
[FR][LoadOrlando]
Yes, Lua? What is it?[AN]
[R]
See if that captain's got anything[N]
that we can use to haul that airship[N]
back to the Keepers' village, alright?[AN]
Pulleys, rolling platforms, whatever...[N]
So long as it gets it back there,[N]
I don't care what the cost is.[AN]
[FR]
As you wish, Lua. It may[N]
eat into most of our budget,[N]
though[Beat] Are you certain?[AN]
[R]
I said that I don't care about the cost,[N]
didn't I? Just get it done, Orlando.[AN]
[FR]
Fine, fine. There goes[N]
my[Beat] our grand windfall[Beat][AN][CSSCF]
[R]
So, can I leave the repairs to you,[N]
Rahel? The crew'd appreciate it.[AN]
[ML]
And so would I. I don't wanna be[N]
here any longer than I have to be,[N]
with these creepy Keepers around.[AN]
It'll take a bit. Probably a few weeks,[N]
maybe more. But I'll rope in whoever[N]
I need to to speed things up, captain.[AN]
[R]
Thanks. I'm counting on you.[A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]

a look at the ship for herself, ha.[A][X]

// Lua is surprised, but surprisingly accepting: She does warn that they may not always be so heroic, given that they're pirates, and all.
// Still, Calista is fine with that, saying that she'll try to steer her in the right direction (a bit of tension, given she's no longer a captain).

Ha! Yes, I suppose you wouldn't.[N]
First, I just wanted to thank you[N]
for saving my life. Truly, I owe you.[AN]

Y-Yeah! Thanks so much, Miss Lua![AN]
[MR]
Don't think anything of it, really.[N]
Just think of it as thanks for Valerie[N]
giving us a heads up on the attack.[AN]
[FL]
Heh[Beat] I was pretty useful, huh?[A]
[L]
That you were, Val. That you were.[N]
[Beat]There was one other matter that[N]
I wanted to talk to you about, Lua.[AN]
What would you think of[Beat][N]
of us joining the Skysabers?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Huh? You want to join the crew?[N]
But you could go back to your troop,[N]

[L]
No, they threw us away, first.[AN]
And truthfully, for a long time,[N]
I've felt myself drifting away[N]
from what it means to be a marine.[AN]
I suppose that being saved twice by[N]
a pirate, and that pirate being the[N]
one who also saved civilian lives[Beat][AN]
It brought it all in perspective.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]And what about you, Valerie?[A]
[FL]
A-Ah[Beat] Honestly, I was kinda scared[N]
when Captain Calista brought this up.[AN]
All I really have are the Marines,[N]
you know[Beat] Never had a family.[AN]
But to me, the Marines aren't the[N]
Marines without Captain Calista![AN]
And I was mad about those guys[N]
leaving us out to dry, too, so[Beat][N]
Yeah, I guess I'm ready to be a pirate![AN]

Welcome aboard, Calista, Valerie.[AN]

Aye aye, captain! Er, Captain Lua![N]
Not you, Captain Calista! Wait,[N]
but you're not my captain anymore[Beat][AN]

[ML][3LB]
[Beat]How do you think I'm holding up?[N]
I told Val to stay away, to run[Beat][N]
But you let her fight with your crew.[AN]
You saw how inexperienced she was.[N]
Why did you do it, Lua? Why didn't[N]
you just tell her to stay behind?![AN]
[MR]
She wasn't a little girl, Calista.[N]
She was a soldier. One who'd do[N]
anything to rescue her captain.[AN]
Even if I told her to stay put,[N]
she'd have followed us anyway.[N]
So I thought she'd be safer with us.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, you were probably right.[N]
And you saved me, in the end, like[N]
she wanted. But Val died because of me.[AN]
[MR]
She did. And it was her choice to do it.[N]
Taking the blame for it only spits[N]
on her choice[Beat] On her resolve.[AN]
[ML]
Hmph[Beat] Perhaps you're right.[AN]
In any case, I wanted to inform you[N]
that you'll never see me fly an[N]

Somewhere along the way, we stopped[N]
being justice's wings in the skies[Beat][N]
The Marines are unrecognizable, to me.[A]

If you're leaving, then what do you plan[N]
to do next? Pal up with the Keepers?[AN]
[ML]
No. I doubt that they would take me,[N]
anyway. Honestly, I have no plans[Beat][N]
Perhaps I'll become a pirate, like you.[AN]
[MR]
H[Beat] Well, why not join us, then?[N]
The Skysabers' doors are always open[N]
to a shot as good as you, Calista.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You're serious?[A]

Of course. I've always felt that[N]
we were similar. Kindred spirits,[N]
even. So having a second me, well[Beat][AN]
I'd like nothing more than that.[AN]
[ML]
Ha[Beat] A little arrogant, aren't we?[N]
But I suppose a pirate captain[N]
had best have some pride, at least.[AN]
I accept your offer, Lua.[N]
Or, I suppose, Captain Lua.[AN]

Call me whatever you like, Calista.[N]
You've got enough tenure for that.[AN]
Now, let's quit the mushy stuff[N]
and get out of here before any[N]

stayed behind to deal with the rogue[N]
Blackhearts. But[Beat] where are they?[AN]
All I see is body after body[Beat] And[N]
not one of them bears Incendivis's crest.[AN]
The two soldiers left behind couldn't[N]
have done this by themselves, surely.[N]
Did the rebels have enough manpower?[AN]
Or[Beat] was there a third party?[N]
Could Captain Lua have been involved?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadSoldier]
C-Commander Elodia! Your orders?[AN]
[MR]
Mm? Orders about what?[AN]
[ML]
Um[Beat] The matter of the depot.[N]
Do we try to attack it ourselves?[N]
It's led by rebels to Incendivis, and-[AN]
[MR]
Rebels who stick to themselves are[N]
hardly rebels at all, lieutenant.[N]
We have bigger fish to fry, no?[AN]
Continue coalescing Incendivis forces,[N]
and have them spend every waking hour[N]
hunting Alonso and Lua. Understood?[AN]
[ML]
Y-Yes, ma'am! Understood![A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[Beat]Hmph. Yet, if my hunch is right,[N]
Lua may be in league with these [OQ]Keepers."[N]
Perhaps I had best do my own scouting[Beat][A][X]

[ML][3LB]
C-Captain Alonso, this is[Beat][N]
That's Salvador, over there![N]
And around him[Beat] Maker, no![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Ain't no Maker lookin' over us,[N]
Dalila. That's for damn sure.[N]
[Beat]Did I steer us wrong, Dalila?[AN]
[ML]
Huh? What are you-[AN]
[MR]
I asked a real easy question.[N]
See, I let that woman Elodia keep[N]
Salvador n' the others with 'er.[AN]
I got most folks with us on that[N]
big boat killed. And now[Beat][N]
Salvador's gone and bit it, too.[AN]
The hell's even left, for us?[N]
May as well disband the damn crew.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]You know, captain, I've thought[N]
a lot of things about you, over the[N]
years. Ever since I joined as a girl.[AN]
Most of them weren't kind, to tell[N]
you the truth. Most of them were[N]
different ways of calling you scum.[AN]
[Beat]But I never thought you'd quit.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Then you don't know me, girl.[AN]
Y'know, for years, I bounced around[N]
from crew to crew. Sometimes, the[N]
crew got busted by marines, so I left.[AN]
Sometimes, they got so sick 'a me[N]
that I got ran outta town, heh.[N]
But most times? I ran away.[AN]
Things got too big. Too serious.[N]
An' I only ever wanted to follow[N]
m' own heart[Beat] black or not.[AN]
I'm no legend. I'm no Ebon Nerve.[N]
Just a man who's lived long 'nough[N]
for other folks to forget who he is.[AN]
[ML][N]
So, all those grand stories about your[N]
adventures before making the crew[Beat][N]
All of it was made up? Just tall tales?[AN]
[MR]
Always was. I'm a fraud, Dalila.[N]
I ain't fit to be a captain. So[Beat][N]
I'm givin' my position to you, now.[AN]
Take it, or break the crew up.[N]
I don't care anymore, either way.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Are you fucking serious?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Dalila, I-[A]
[ML]
Do you have any idea what the crew[N]
has become because of all of your lies?[N]
And you think you get to back out now?[AN]
We're all here because of you![N]
We became one of the most feared[N]
crews in the skies because of you![AN]
And[Beat] Salvador and Khazhak died,[N]
believing in you. You would walk[N]
away now and prove them wrong?[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[ML]
[OQ]Deceive before we can be deceived.[N]
Take before we can be taken from.[N]
Kill before we can be killed."[AN]
[Beat]If those words meant anything to you,[N]
then stay. Stay with us, Captain Alonso![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Heh. To think m' own words would[N]
come back and make me tear up[Beat][N]
I'm glad you're my first mate, Dalila.[AN]
[ML]
Does[Beat] Does that mean-[A]
[MR][OpenEyes]
Aye, I'm not quittin'. Not til[N]
I've got both feet in the grave.[AN]
But I've got an eye for more than[N]
vengeance, lass. If we wanna[N]
do right by Salvador and Khazhak,[AN]
we'll need to rebuild the crew.[N]
And before that, we'll need to[N]
get the hell outta these isles.[AN]
[ML]
O-Of course! I'll order the others[N]
to scrounge around for a ship.[AN]
There are rebels around here[Beat][N]
I'll find an opportunity to steal[N]
an airship right under their noses.[AN]
[MR]
Ha! Good lass! But before that,[N]
we've got one more job to do.[AN]
You lot! Even if it takes us all night,[N]
I'll not let a single Blackheart become[N]
food for the flies! Start diggin'![A][X]

## C2ExplanationText_1
Calista is currently holding[N]
off against the Blackhearts.[AN]
Any unit can talk to her[N]
to rescue and recruit her.[A][X]

## C2ExplanationText_2
However, the ultimate goal is[N]
to defeat the co-captain.[AN]
(Note: There's no reward for all[N]
the rebel units surviving the map.)[A][X]

## CalistaRecruit_Generic
[ML][LoadActive]
[MR][LoadA4ImperialCaptain]
[Beat]Heh.[AN]
I wasn't expecting to have my[N]
life saved by you all again.[AN]
A bit distasteful for a[N]
captain like myself[Beat][N]
But, I can lament more later;[....][N]
the Blackhearts still threat.[AN]
I've got the firearm just for him.[AN][X]

## C2BridgeLowered_T4
[MR][LoadAlonso]
Lower that bridge down![AN]
Start pushing through that route![AN][X]

## C2_GriffonWarning_T6_CalistaAlive
What the hell's going on here?[AN]
Where is the captain?[AN]

She's betrayed us!
We found some rebels, and she[N]
flipped as soon as we took losses![AN]

And how are we supposed to
take your word for that?

Sir, I saw a girl wearing imperial 
armor behind in their lines.[AN]
With Captain Calista also
fighting his forces...[AN]
He's telling the truth.[AN]

Bloody...
Very well. 
Lieutenant, follow me and we'll
send a report back to the camp.
You two, maneuver from the back,
flank the captain's position. [AN]
We won't tolerate traitors in TORCH![AN]

Understood, sir![AN][X]

[MR][LoadA4ImperialCaptain]
Those griffins are coming in hot.[AN]
Not close enough for a shot...[CloseEyes]
this isn't looking good.[AN][X]

## C2_T11_CalistaAlive
//All enemies are set to charge AI. 
[MR][LoadAlonso]
The crew's on its last legs[Beat][AN] 
And that imperial dog[N] 
still managed to live?![AN]
...Damn Skysabers![AN]
We aren't going to
die facing down![....][N]
All remaining hands,[N]
charge, now![AN][X]
