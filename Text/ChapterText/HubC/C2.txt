[MR][LoadLua]

[ML]
Ah, you must be the captain[N]
Quispe told me about, yes?[AN]
An unexpected visitor?[AN]

[MR]
You could say that.[AN]
And a visitor that's in[N]
need for a lot of materials.[AN]

[ML]
Yes, he also told me that your[N]
landing was[Beat]less than ideal.[AN]
Worry not though, I'm preparing[N]
to head back to a supply depot.[AN]
The name's Pavel, I work with[N]
logistics here with the Keepers.[AN]
Normally, I don't deal much with pirates[.4]-[N]
but your connection with Pilar is good.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I have a big convoy[N]
coming in a few days[Beat][AN]
But for a crew like yours,[N]
I doubt that'd be enough.[AN]


[MR]
What's that supposed to imply?[AN]

[ML]
N-Nothing bad, if that's[N]
what you're thinking.[AN]
Just that you have a rather[N]
large crew of pirates and all[Beat][AN]
What exactly are you looking[N]
to acquire for yourself?[AN]

[MR][3LB]
Nothing that scales[N]
to the size of my crew.[AN]
Just my ship[AN]which is pretty[N]
dinged up, and needs lumber and[N]
iron for serious hull repairs.[AN]
[Beat]And perhaps some[N]
able shipwrights to help repair[N]
her in a timely manner? [AN]

[ML][2LB]
That is a tall request, captain.[AN]
Raw materials are one thing,[N]
but shipwrights-[AN]

[MR]
Are people hard to come by[N]
around here, yeah, I get it.[AN]
Is it off the table, or do you have[N]
a job that'll make up for it?[AN]

[ML]
[ToggleSmile]
It's as if you're begging to turn[N]
into laborers for a few days.[AN]

[MR][3LB]
Laborers?[A] That seriously[N]
can't be the first thing you think[N]
of with a crew of crack pirates.[AN]

[ML][MoML]
W-Well, I can't say I'm[N]
versed much with combat.[AN]
I'm more of a supply officer-[.4]I[N]
see value in just having more hands.[AN]
But[Beat]to get to your language, I'd also[N]
take getting some cold, hard, coin.[AN]


[MR]
In that case[Beat]we might[N]
be able to work something out.[AN][TMM]
(Not having to do a job would[N]
be a nice change of pace[Beat])[AN]
[Beat]
[HalfCloseEyes]
(But, something tells me these prices[N]
are going to be less than reasonable.)[AN]
[CloseEyes]
(Still[Beat]it might be one of the[N]
only chances we've got[Beat])[AN][X]

## HubC2Accepted

[ML][LoadRebelSupplier]
[MR][LoadLua]

[MR]
I'll hear your offer out.[AN]
Not like I really have a[N]
lot of choices out here.[AN]

[ML]
Heh, if you're going to be[N]
here in the Old World[Beat][AN]
Gotta make use of whatever[N]
opportunities come along.[AN]
Get your crew ready, we'll[N]
be leaving pretty shortly.[AN]


[AN][ClearFace][CSS]

[MR]
[Beat]If this is going to be his attitude,[N]
then I don't like where this is going.[AN][X]

## HubC2Rejected

[ML][LoadRebelSupplier]
[MR][LoadLua]
I'll need time to[N]
consider this.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Really, not raring to go?[AN]
Ah well, I'll wait until you've[N]
got a better idea on things.[AN][X]

## C2_Synopsis_A
CURRENT SYNOPSIS OF C2[N]
(Feel free to skip!)[AN][Clear]
The Skysabers are attempting to[N]
purchase supplies in Keeper territory,[N]
going to a depot village to do so.[AN]
Little do they know, a large contingent[N]
of Blackhearts, commanded by another[N]
one of Alonso's co-captains, approaches.[AN]
There is a small retinue of imperials[N]
accompanying them, including the imperial[N]
captain met in A4, Calista. [AN]
However, the TORCH members are mostly[N]
fliers;[....] they were sent off to grab[N]
more supplies for this large party.[AN]

When the Blackheart warband sights the[N]
depot, their first instinct is[N]
to charge and plunder the village.[AN]
Calista opposes this plan, thanks to[N]
convincing from Valerie, the recruit[N]
initally found during A4 too.[AN]
Enraged by the captain shutting them[N]
down, they turn hostile.[AN]
Calista quickly rescues Valerie,[N]
and retreats toward the village.[AN]
Knowing the Blackhearts are relentless,[N]
Calista buys Valerie time to run by[N]
holding out in an old fort she sighted.[AN]
Valerie flees towards the village alone.[AN][X]

## C2_Synopsis_B
Lua attempts to haggle with the Keeper[N]
supplier, which also gets Orlando to[N]
throw in Pilar as a reason for a discount.[AN]
Before Lua voices further disdain, Keeper[N]
guards report in, citing a fleeing imperial[N]
soldier coming towards them...[AN]
...And also a bunch of pirates in pursuit.[AN]
Lua runs ahead to see more of the commotion,[N]
and recognizes Valerie from A4.[AN]
Demanding the Keepers hold their fire,[N]
Valerie rushes in through the perimeter,[N]
and quickly helps describe the situation.[AN]

As she does so, the Keepers report taking[N]
heavy losses, and that the pirates [N]
are about to breach their lines.[AN]
The supplier, knowing they don't [N]
have many able men ready to fight,[N]
realizes Lua is their only hope.[AN]
They offer supplies for free to Lua,[N]
which convinces her to help[N]
defend the village.[AN]
Valerie insists that they try[N]
to push through and help Calista.[AN]
Lua listens, and agrees, but[N]
cannot make any promises.[AN][X]

[FFL][LoadCalista][3LB]
Heh[Beat][AN]
To think we're working with killers[N]
in the middle of nowhere.[AN]
What the hells have[N]
I gotten into[Beat]?[AN]

[FL][LoadValerie]

[FL]
You dozed off there for a bit.[AN]
Just asked if you were good?[AN]

Y-Yes.[.4] Yes.[AN]
The rough terrain's not too bad,[N]
so I'm simply[Beat]relaxing.[AN][X]

So, you're just, relaxing, eh?[AN]
Hah![A] You getting tired up[N]
on your high horse, 'captain'?[AN]
How about you come down here[N]
and get blisters like the rest of us?[AN]

[FL]
The captain can do what she wants![AN]
She was helping gather earlier too,[N]
there's nothing wrong with a break![AN]

[FR][LoadPirate]
We just found a couple wyverns[N]
here and called it a day![AN]
Damn things like being out[N]
here more than anything, hah![AN][CSS]

[FL][ClearFace][LoadRedSoldier]
And Maker knows I don't want[N]
to hear what you fed 'em.[AN]

[FR]
Making assumptions, eh?[N]
Well well, if you're all[AN]

[FFL][LoadRedSoldier]
Hey, hey![AN]
We're all on the same side,[N]
doing some routine f-all.[AN]
The least you all can do is[N]
act civilized while at it![AN]

[L][CloseEyes]

[FFR]
Look at that, the mongrels[N]
trying to tell us to be civilized?[AN]
Tell ya what, I'll be civilized once[N]
you stick your lance up your-[AN]

[L][MoL][OpenEyes]
That's enough, all of you![AN]

[FL][LoadValerie]
[MR][LoadRedSoldier]

[L]
[Beat]All this over me closing[N]
my eyes for just a moment.[AN]
Damn Blackhearts[AN]

[R]
Simple captain.
They've never taken a moment[N]
to think before in their lives.[AN]

[L]
I feel that way, Ramirez, but that[N]
attitude is getting us nowhere. [AN]

[R]
Aren't we supposed to be their retinue?[AN]
They oughta show some respect here.[AN]

[FL]
And their captain didn't even care[Beat]![AN]
Guh, he had a stupid, cocky smirk[N]
in the back while that went down[Beat][AN][X]

##Hub_C2_Intro_3B

[L][LoadCalista]
[FL][LoadValerie]
[MR][LoadRedSoldier]

[FL][1LB]
Hmm[Beat]what's going on there?[AN]

[L][2LB]
A wyvern.[A] Looks like one of[N]
their scouts has returned.[AN]
Keep forging, I'll go investigate.[AN][X]

##Hub_C2_Intro_4A

[ML][LoadPirate]
[MR][LoadSalvador]

[MR]
[Beat]off to the south?[AN]
Well well, things are[N]
gettin' real interesting.[AN]
Boys, stop your gatherin',[N]
and get ready for a march![AN][X]

##Hub_C2_Intro_4B
[R][LoadSalvador]
[FFL][LoadCalista][MoML]
[L]
Now hold on just a moment.[AN]
What did your scout see that's[N]
gotten you so riled up?[AN]

[R]
Apparently they saw a village[N]
down past all of these woods.[AN]
Never saw it 'cause we were too[N]
busy chopping wood and crap.[AN]

[FR]
It's gotta be one of 'em rebel bases[Beat][AN]
Finally, can we get some action![AN]

[L]
We can just fall back, and relay[N]
the position back to the base.[AN]
We've gathered enough food, and[N]
can wait for more reinforcements.[AN]

[FL]
Reinforcements[Beat][N]
Just how long are those again?[AN]

[L]
Depending how bad the storms[N]
are-might take several days.[AN]

[FR]
Several days[Beat][A][MoFR]you're[N]
just screwing with us![AN]

[R]
Yeah, not so fast, captain![AN]
We've already got plenty of men[N]
with our little band here.[AN][Clear]
That place won't give us Lua's corpse, [N]
but we'll take what we can get, eh?[AN]
It'd be a bonus to fill our wagons[N]
with more than just food and water.[AN]

[L]
You band of merry men might be[N]
raring to go, but we have orders.[AN]
It may not be glamorous, but[N]
we're expected to follow them.[AN]

[R]
This is rebel territory here![AN]
The untamed isles and wilderness![AN]
If there's a village here[Beat]they're[N]
practically begging to be raided.[AN]

[L]
But we need to make sure that-[AN]

[FR]
And, what if they find our camp[N]
while we sit on our asses?[AN]
Just let the whole island mobilize?[.4][CloseEyes][N]
Only makes sense to hit 'em first![AN][X]

##Hub_C2_Intro_5
//Valerie walks up to Calista quickly.

[FL][LoadValerie]
[L][LoadCalista]

[FL]
C-Captain, wait.[AN]
Permission to[N]
speak freely?[AN]

[L]
[Beat]I let you speak[AN]
freely, what's bothering you?[N]

[FL]
I-It's just that[Beat][N]
C-Captain,[.4] we can't just[Beat][AN][MoML]
We can't just let these[N]

[L]
[Beat]Valerie, hush. [A]I know that[N]
I'm the one in charge here.[AN]
[Beat]But, he does bring up[N]
a good point about the area.[AN]
You've heard the reports-[.4]expect[N]
high rebel activity in the Old World[AN]

[FL]
So what if he has a point?[N]
We're assuming this whole[N]
place wants to kill us[Beat][AN]
That village could just have[N]
innocent people inside it![AN]

[MR][ToggleSmile]
What the? Aren't you imperials[N]
hellbent on flogging rebels?![AN]

[L]
B-But we don't have proof,[N]
you bloodthirsty dastard![AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Why you little-[AN]

[FL]
Besides[Beat][AN]
Don't[Beat]don't we have a main[N]
objective here over anything?[AN]

[L]
...Capture Lua. Dead or alive[N]
Isn't that what you wanted, Durian?[AN]
The reason why you volunteered[N]
to fly into those horrid storms?[AN]

[MR]
'course I want to have Lua's[AN]
crew six thousand feet under![N]
But you, you're going to listen[N]
to this girl and not-[AN]

[L][3LB]
I've decided this![.5][N]
We cannot go gung-ho[N]
on an unknown force.[AN]
I'm ordering us all to head to[N]
camp, then get more intel on the[N]
village, and Lua's whereabouts.[AN]
We only strike if the rebels are[N]
there for sure, and we don't have[N]
any other leads-that's final.[AN]
Is that clear, Durian?[AN]
