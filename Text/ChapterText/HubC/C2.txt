B-Boss! We about done runnin'?[N]
I'm really feelin' the burn![AN]
[MR]
Good. You could use a bit less[N]
fat on those bones, Rodri.[AN]
[ML]
Ah, c'mon! Ain't we run long enough?[N]
We got clear out of that impy fleet[N]
quick. They can't be that close![AN]
[MR]
Would you gamble all[AN]
of our lives on that?[AN]
[ML]
Er[Beat] No, but-[AN]
[MR]
We've run into enough trouble since[N]
we escaped T.O.R.C.H., as it is.[AN]
They just keep hounding us[Beat][N]
If we slow down now, the Blackhearts[N]
may become nothing more than a memory.[AN]
[ML]
Huh? Sure, the captain's ship went down,[N]
but you don't really think that Captain[N]
Alonso bit the dust, do ya? That's[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Crazy. No, I believe that he's alive.[N]
And if he is, then we have to find him[N]
and any of the other survivors, quickly.[AN]
The Old World isn't the one we know[Beat][N]
Stick around any longer, and even he'll[N]
run into trouble without the whole crew.[A]
[ML]
W-Well, can we at least raid that[N]
village, over there? It don't look[N]
too defended. And we could use food.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Food, or loot?[N]
Which are you after?[AN]
[ML]
Rumble in my stomach says food,[N]
the Blackhearts' code says loot[Beat][N]
Either way, I think it's a good idea.[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] It does look sparsely defended.[N]
And we're running low on weapons[Beat][N]
Alright, Rodri. We'll raid the town.[AN]
But don't waste any time having fun.[N]
Our getaway ship isn't getting anywhere,[N]
anymore, so we need to make this quick.[AN]

Aye aye, boss![A][X]

[ML][3LB]
[Beat]You heard it like I did,[N]
captain. The Blackhearts[N]
mean to raid that town.[AN]
We should head back to base,[N]
let Commander Elodia know,[N]
and make ready to wipe them out.[A]
[FR]
W-What about the town, though?[N]
There are people walking around.[N]
Kids. And the Blackhearts[Beat] They'll[Beat][AN]
[ML]
People? Maybe, but they aren't ours.[AN]
[R]
People are people, no matter what[N]
flag they fly. Or do you view those[N]
in the Old World as lesser? Subhuman?[AN]
[ML]
No, but I'm not laying my life on the[N]
line to save damned rebels, no matter[N]
how many suckling babes they've got.[AN]
[R]
I swore an oath to protect people.[N]
So did you. And you mean to watch[N]
as pirates slaughter innocents?[AN]
We can send one person to report[N]
the situation, but as for the rest-[AN]
[ML]
Pah! I swore an oath to protect[N]
Incendivis, not traitorous scum![AN]
You want to do it? Do it yourself.[N]
The rest of us'll go report to[N]
Commander Elodia, as ordered.[AN][X]

[ML]
[Beat]Good riddance.[A]
[MR][3LB]
C-Captain! I'm so sorry.[N]
If I hadn't spoken up,[N]
then maybe they would-[AN]
[ML]
You have no reason to apologize,[N]
Val. And no time for it, either.[AN]
I need you to go inform the villagers[N]
that a pirate attack is imminent.[N]
Meanwhile[Beat] I'll act as decoy.[AN]
[MR]
Captain Calista, you can't![AN]
I mean, there's so many of them.[N]
No matter how strong you are,[N]
you[Beat] you don't have a chance![AN]
[ML]
Ha! Come now, Val. Don't count[N]
me out before the battle's begun.[N]
We've survived worse, haven't we?[AN]
[MR]
Mm[Beat] I don't know about that.[N]
The Fairwind Corridor wasn't[N]
this bad, I don't think[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]We were saved by pirates, that day.[N]
Frankly, I've viewed myself as living[N]
on borrowed time ever since, Val.[AN]
So, even if I do fall here[Beat] If it[N]
means that a single family escapes[N]
the Blackhearts, then I've no complaints.[AN]
[Beat]Now, go. That's an order.[A]
[MR]
F-Fine! But I'll be back, captain![N]
So don't stop fighting til I am![A][X]

// Then, Calista confronts Salvador, successfully provokes some of the Blackhearts to follow her to a fort...

[FR]
I can see that myself, idiot.[N]
I told you that we'd have problems[N]
if we slowed down the pace here[Beat][AN]
[ML]
I could smell you all from leagues away,[N]
so honestly, stopping here or running[Beat][N]
It really wouldn't make a difference.[AN]
[R]
Hey, I bathe every damn day![AN]
[ML]
Could have fooled me, honestly.[A]
[R]
Grr[Beat] Fine, you want a fight that bad![N]
Then I'll give you one, you bitch![A]
[FR]
Damn it, Rodri! Don't fall for-[A][X]

// Even though the leader of the group tells them not to take the bait and is frustrated by their lack of discipline. Still, he tells everyone else to get that raid done before

## HubC_2_BeginningScene5
[MidRight][LoadSalvador][3LB]
[Beat]The bait. So much for a quick raid.[N]
Everyone else, don't follow Rodri's lead![N]
Focus on the town and tear it apart![AN]
And if anyone stands in your way[Beat][N]
Then tear them apart, too![AN][X]

of their forces away as I could.[N]
Val[Beat] Good luck, and godspeed.[A][X]

Look, I'm not negotiating down.[N]
Normally, we wouldn't even sell[N]
to you outsiders. You should be-[AN]
[R]
Grateful, when you're trying to rip[N]
us off? You're charging one and a half[N]
times the regular price, you thief![AN]
[ML]
Hmph. The value of building supplies[N]
is simply different, in the Old World.[AN]
We make little more than we need,[N]
and only the odd merchant ship[N]
sails here to let us restock.[AN]
So if you want our wares,[N]
then you must pay more.[N]
That is my final say on the matter.[A]
[FR]
Now, now. No need to rush to judgement,[N]
my good man. Surely you can bend just[N]
a bit to make such a lucrative sale, yes?[AN]
After all, we count ourselves boon[N]
companions of the esteemed Lady Pilar![N]
Does her name mean naught to you?[AN]
[ML]
Hmph. It means that you count yourselves[N]
friends to a woman too accustomed to the[N]
outside world. In my view, an apostate.[AN]
But she was quite close to the former[N]
chief, and helped raise the current[Beat][N]
I can offer you a 5% discount, perhaps.[AN]

She[Beat] She's trying to hold them[N]

Is that so? Well, what a conundrum![N]
If only a valorous band of warriors[N]
could come to this depot's rescue[Beat][AN]

Hm? Ah. Yes, yes. If only, Orlando.[N]
But you know, brave fighters don't[N]
come free. Nothing good does, yeah?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]What do you want, scoundrels?[AN]
[R]
Oh, nothing crazy. Just[Beat][N]
The right to buy your supplies,[N]
discounted at 50% the normal rate.[AN]
[FL]
50[Beat] You mean to extort our plight?![AN]
[FR]
Oh, extort is such an ugly word[Beat][N]
Were you not the one who spoke[N]
of the value of a product, earlier?[AN]
It just so happens that, at this time,[N]
the value of stalwart depot defenders[N]
is higher than usual. We would be[Beat][AN]
remiss, not to adjust to that fact.[N]
Is that not so, oh captain of mine?[A]
[R]
Oh, it's so, alright.[N]
So, what's it going to be?[N]
Ready to seal the deal yet?[AN]
[FL]

We did save your lives, after all.[AN]

The situation is that our pirate[N]

Take a look off into the horizon.[AN]
[ML]
That[Beat] That's an airship![N]
And a real one! Not some dinghy[N]
that can barely hold five dudes.[AN]

You think it'll work for us?[AN]
[ML]
Well, it definitely looks big enough.[N]
Can't fully say what the condition[N]
is til I get a little closer, but[Beat][AN]
It looks grounded. Not big repairs,[N]
I'd bet, but it won't fly for a bit.[AN]
[R]
Hm[Beat] Orlando![AN]
[FR][LoadOrlando]
Yes, Lua? What is it?[AN]
[R]
See if that captain's got anything[N]
that we can use to haul that airship[N]
back to the Keepers' village, alright?[AN]
Pulleys, rolling platforms, whatever...[N]
So long as it gets it back there,[N]
I don't care what the cost is.[AN]
[FR]
As you wish, Lua. It may[N]
eat into most of our budget,[N]
though[Beat] Are you certain?[AN]

I said that I don't care about the cost,[N]
didn't I? Just get it done, Orlando.[AN]

Fine, fine. There goes[N]
my[Beat] our grand windfall[Beat][AN][CSSCF]

So, can I leave the repairs to you,[N]
Rahel? The crew'd appreciate it.[AN]
[ML]
And so would I. I don't wanna be[N]
here any longer than I have to be,[N]
with these creepy Keepers around.[AN]
It'll take a bit. Probably a few weeks,[N]
maybe more. But I'll rope in whoever[N]
I need to to speed things up, captain.[AN]

Thanks. I'm counting on you.[A]

// Lua is surprised, but surprisingly accepting: She does warn that they may not always be so heroic, given that they're pirates, and all.

Heh[Beat] I was pretty useful, huh?[A]

That you were, Val. That you were.[N]
[Beat]There was one other matter that[N]

No, they threw us away, first.[AN]
And truthfully, for a long time,[N]
I've felt myself drifting away[N]

I suppose that being saved twice by[N]

one who also saved civilian lives[Beat][AN]
It brought it all in perspective.[AN]

A-Ah[Beat] Honestly, I was kinda scared[N]
when Captain Calista brought this up.[AN]
All I really have are the Marines,[N]
you know[Beat] Never had a family.[AN]
But to me, the Marines aren't the[N]

I told Val to stay away, to run[Beat][N]
But you let her fight with your crew.[AN]
You saw how inexperienced she was.[N]
Why did you do it, Lua? Why didn't[N]
you just tell her to stay behind?![AN]
[MR]
She wasn't a little girl, Calista.[N]
She was a soldier. One who'd do[N]
anything to rescue her captain.[AN]
Even if I told her to stay put,[N]
she'd have followed us anyway.[N]
So I thought she'd be safer with us.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, you were probably right.[N]
And you saved me, in the end, like[N]
she wanted. But Val died because of me.[AN]
[MR]
She did. And it was her choice to do it.[N]
Taking the blame for it only spits[N]
on her choice[Beat] On her resolve.[AN]

Hmph[Beat] Perhaps you're right.[AN]
In any case, I wanted to inform you[N]

No. I doubt that they would take me,[N]
anyway. Honestly, I have no plans[Beat][N]
Perhaps I'll become a pirate, like you.[AN]

H[Beat] Well, why not join us, then?[N]
The Skysabers' doors are always open[N]

Hm[Beat] I had heard that a few Marines[N]
stayed behind to deal with the rogue[N]
Blackhearts. But[Beat] where are they?[AN]
All I see is body after body[Beat] And[N]
not one of them bears Incendivis's crest.[AN]
The two soldiers left behind couldn't[N]
have done this by themselves, surely.[N]
Did the rebels have enough manpower?[AN]
Or[Beat] was there a third party?[N]
Could Captain Lua have been involved?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadSoldier]
C-Commander Elodia! Your orders?[AN]
[MR]
Mm? Orders about what?[AN]
[ML]
Um[Beat] The matter of the depot.[N]
Do we try to attack it ourselves?[N]
It's led by rebels to Incendivis, and-[AN]
[MR]
Rebels who stick to themselves are[N]
hardly rebels at all, lieutenant.[N]
We have bigger fish to fry, no?[AN]
Continue coalescing Incendivis forces,[N]
and have them spend every waking hour[N]
hunting Alonso and Lua. Understood?[AN]
[ML]
Y-Yes, ma'am! Understood![A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[Beat]Hmph. Yet, if my hunch is right,[N]
Lua may be in league with these [OQ]Keepers."[N]
Perhaps I had best do my own scouting[Beat][A][X]

## C2_EndingScene_Alonso
[MidLeft][LoadDalila][3LB]
[MidRight][LoadAlonso]
[ML][3LB]
C-Captain Alonso, this is[Beat][N]
That's Salvador, over there![N]
And around him[Beat] Maker, no![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Ain't no Maker lookin' over us,[N]
Dalila. That's for damn sure.[N]
[Beat]Where'd I steer us wrong?[AN]
[ML]
Huh? What are you-[AN]
[MR]
I asked a real easy question.[N]
See, I let that woman Elodia keep[N]
Salvador n' the others with 'er.[AN]
I got most 'a the crew with us[N]
on that big boat killed. And now[Beat][N]
Salvador's gone and bit it, too.[AN]
The hell's even left, for us?[N]
May as well disband the damn crew.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]You know, captain, I've thought[N]
a lot of things about you, over the[N]
years. Ever since I joined as a girl.[AN]
Most of them weren't kind, to tell[N]
you the truth. Most of them were[N]
different ways of calling you scum.[AN]
[Beat]But I never thought you'd quit.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Then you don't know me, girl.[AN]
Y'know, for years, I bounced around[N]
from crew to crew. Sometimes, the[N]
crew got busted by marines, so I left.[AN]
Sometimes, they got so sick 'a me[N]
that I got ran outta town, heh.[N]
But most times? I ran away.[AN]
Things got too big. Too serious.[N]
An' I only ever wanted to follow[N]
m' own heart[Beat] black or not.[AN]
I'm no legend. I'm no Ebon Nerve.[N]
Just a man who's lived long 'nough[N]
for other folks to forget who he is.[AN]
[ML][N]
So, all those grand stories about your[N]
adventures before making the crew[Beat][N]
All of it was made up? Just tall tales?[AN]
[MR]
Always was. I'm a fraud, Dalila.[N]
I ain't fit to be a captain. So[Beat][N]
I'm givin' my position to you, now.[AN]
Take it, or break the crew up.[N]
I don't care anymore, either way.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Are you fucking serious?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Dalila, I-[A]
[ML]
Do you have any idea what the crew[N]
has become because of all of your lies?[N]
And you think you get to back out now?[AN]
We're all here because of you![N]
We became one of the most feared[N]
crews in the skies because of you![AN]
And[Beat] Salvador and Khazhak died,[N]
believing in you. You would walk[N]
away now and prove them wrong?[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[ML]
[OQ]Deceive before we can be deceived.[N]
Take before we can be taken from.[N]
Kill before we can be killed."[AN]
[Beat]If those words meant anything to you,[N]
then stay. Stay with us, Captain Alonso![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Heh. To think m' own words would[N]
come back and make me tear up[Beat][N]
I'm glad you're my first mate, Dalila.[AN]
[ML]
Does[Beat] Does that mean-[A]
[MR][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
Aye, I'm not quittin'. Not til[N]
I've got both feet in the grave.[AN]
But I've got an eye for more than[N]
vengeance, lass. If we wanna[N]
do right by Salvador and Khazhak,[AN]
we'll need to rebuild the crew.[N]
And before that, we'll need to[N]
get the hell outta these isles.[AN]
[ML]
O-Of course! I'll order the others[N]
to scrounge around for a ship.[AN]
There are rebels around here[Beat][N]
I'll find an opportunity to steal[N]
an airship right under their noses.[AN]
[MR]
Ha! Good lass! But before that,[N]
we've got one more job to do.[AN]
You lot! Even if it takes us all night,[N]
I'll not let a single Blackheart become[N]
food for the flies! Start diggin'![A][X]

Hah![A] You getting tired up[N]
on your high horse, 'captain'?[AN]
How about you come down here[N]
and get blisters like the rest of us?[AN]

[FL]
The captain can do what she wants![AN]
She was helping gather earlier too,[N]
there's nothing wrong with a break![AN]

[FR][LoadPirate]
We just found a couple wyverns[N]
here and called it a day![AN]
Damn things like being out[N]
here more than anything, hah![AN][CSS]

[FL][ClearFace][LoadRedSoldier]
And Maker knows I don't want[N]
to hear what you fed 'em.[AN]

[FR]
Making assumptions, eh?[N]
Well well, if you're all[AN]

[FFL][LoadRedSoldier]
Hey, hey![AN]
We're all on the same side,[N]
doing some routine f-all.[AN]
The least you all can do is[N]
act civilized while at it![AN]

trying to tell us to be civilized?[AN]
Tell ya what, I'll be civilized once[N]

my eyes for just a moment.[AN]
Damn Blackhearts[AN]

[R]
Simple captain.
They've never taken a moment[N]
to think before in their lives.[AN]

[L]
I feel that way, Ramirez, but that[N]
attitude is getting us nowhere. [AN]

[R]
Aren't we supposed to be their retinue?[AN]
They oughta show some respect here.[AN]

[FL]
And their captain didn't even care[Beat]![AN]
Guh, he had a stupid, cocky smirk[N]
in the back while that went down[Beat][AN][X]

##Hub_C2_Intro_4B

[FFL][LoadCalista][MoML]
[L]
Now hold on just a moment.[AN]
What did your scout see that's[N]
gotten you so riled up?[AN]

[R]
Apparently they saw a village[N]
down past all of these woods.[AN]
Never saw it 'cause we were too[N]
busy chopping wood and crap.[AN]

[FR]
It's gotta be one of 'em rebel bases[Beat][AN]
Finally, can we get some action![AN]

[L]
We can just fall back, and relay[N]
the position back to the base.[AN]
We've gathered enough food, and[N]
can wait for more reinforcements.[AN]

[FL]
Reinforcements[Beat][N]
Just how long are those again?[AN]

[L]
Depending how bad the storms[N]
are-might take several days.[AN]

[FR]
Several days[Beat][A][MoFR]you're[N]
just screwing with us![AN]

[R]
Yeah, not so fast, captain![AN]
We've already got plenty of men[N]
with our little band here.[AN][Clear]
That place won't give us Lua's corpse, [N]
but we'll take what we can get, eh?[AN]
It'd be a bonus to fill our wagons[N]
with more than just food and water.[AN]

[L]
You band of merry men might be[N]
raring to go, but we have orders.[AN]
It may not be glamorous, but[N]
we're expected to follow them.[AN]

[R]
This is rebel territory here![AN]
The untamed isles and wilderness![AN]
If there's a village here[Beat]they're[N]
practically begging to be raided.[AN]

[L]
But we need to make sure that-[AN]

[FR]
And, what if they find our camp[N]
while we sit on our asses?[AN]
Just let the whole island mobilize?[.4][CloseEyes][N]
Only makes sense to hit 'em first![AN][X]

freely, what's bothering you?[N]

[Beat]Valerie, hush. [A]I know that[N]
I'm the one in charge here.[AN]

a good point about the area.[AN]
You've heard the reports-[.4]expect[N]
high rebel activity in the Old World[AN]

[FL]
So what if he has a point?[N]
We're assuming this whole[N]
place wants to kill us[Beat][AN]
That village could just have[N]
innocent people inside it![AN]

What the? Aren't you imperials[N]

Don't[Beat]don't we have a main[N]
objective here over anything?[AN]

...Capture Lua. Dead or alive[N]
Isn't that what you wanted, Durian?[AN]
The reason why you volunteered[N]
to fly into those horrid storms?[AN]

[MR]
'course I want to have Lua's[AN]
crew six thousand feet under![N]
But you, you're going to listen[N]
to this girl and not-[AN]

[L][3LB]
I've decided this![.5][N]
We cannot go gung-ho[N]
on an unknown force.[AN]
I'm ordering us all to head to[N]
camp, then get more intel on the[N]
village, and Lua's whereabouts.[AN]
We only strike if the rebels are[N]
there for sure, and we don't have[N]
any other leads-that's final.[AN]
Is that clear, Durian?[AN]
