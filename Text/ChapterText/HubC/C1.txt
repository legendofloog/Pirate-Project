[ML]
Wha- you? Again?[AN]
I thought I was finally[N]
done with your sorry lot![A]
[MR][3LB]
I wish I could say[N]
the same, Hermen.[AN]
Never before were any[N]
of our prisoners quite[N]
as[Beat] abrasive as you.[A]
[ML]
Abrasive? Perhaps for you.[AN]
But at times, Captain Lua's[N]
treatment almost makes me[N]
miss your ministrations.[A]
[MR][2LB]
I see she lets you[N]
carry a sword, now.[AN]
At least you can take[N]
bullets on the front line.[A]
[ML]
Yes. She does.[AN]
And I seem to have proven to[N]
be useful, if nothing else.[AN]
[Beat]We're going up against[N]
one[Beat] Count Sanz, are we not?[A]
[MR][3LB]
Yeah. We are. [ToggleSmile]And I suppose[N]
you'll help us cut him down.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Come to think of it,[AN]
didn't we find you in House Sanz[N]
territory in the first place?[A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]Maybe so. It feels[N]
like a lifetime ago.[AN]
But [ToggleRed]I'd like to participate[N]
in the fight today[ToggleRed].[AN]
I have[Beat] [CloseEyes]some painful[N]
history with Count Sanz.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll not stand aside[N]
and swab the deck now.[A]
[MR]
I don't make the call on[N]
whether or not you're deployed.[AN]
But Captain Lua's soft.[AN]

You know the treachery they've[N]
tried on us before, Biko.[A]
[ML]
I don't think they can[N]
try anything now, though.[AN]
Captain Lua is stronger than ever,[N]
and the Rioja Reapers are gone.[AN]
This [OpenQuote]Ruby" won't be claiming[N]
any debt of ours alone.[A]
[MR]
Debt of mine. And it sits[N]
ill with me, all the same.[A]
[MR][MoveFarRight]
[ML][ClearFace]
[R][LoadBiko]
[ML][LoadRuby]
[ML]
I see I've become the[N]

Aren't you two the kids[N]
who owed Sagargala a loan?[A]
[FR]
He's dead. And none of[N]
us owe anything, anymore.[A]
[ML]
Dead at your hands. Don't[N]
think I don't know that.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]But he had it coming, and[N]
we still have work to do[OpenEyes].[A]
[FR]
Yeah. Captain Lua[N]
has a job for us.[AN]
C'mon, Biko. Let's get[N]
ready for the fight ahead.[A]
[FR][ClearFace]
[R][MoveMidRight]
[MR]
[Beat]Y'know, I do have to say[Beat][N]
[ToggleSmile]Thanks. Despite it all[ToggleSmile].[A]
[ML]
What are you thanking me for?[AN]
Me and mine tried to[N]
sell you like trade goods.[A]
[MR]
I know. But that's[N]
in the past, now.[AN]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]And you did save both[N]
of our lives, back then.[AN]
[CloseEyes]The dashing hero atop[N]
her mighty pirate ship[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I guess I'm still thankful[N]
that you brought us to freedom,[AN]
no matter what else your[N]
crew brought us ever since.[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]A valiant hero[Beat][ToggleSmile] Hah. If[N]
only it could be that easy.[AN]

redemption out of me.[A][X]

[MR]
Gotta say, Captain Lua,[AN]
I never thought I'd be the[N]
one taking orders from you.[A]
[ML]
It must be strange, after spending[N]
your life bossing others around.[A]
[MR]
Strange isn't the word for[N]
it, Lua. Just[Beat] angry.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've lost my whole crew, and[N]
all my friends among them.[AN]
The only one willing to help me[N]
is the woman who killed Sagargala.[AN]
I've lost all my business, all[N]
my goals[Beat] [OpenEyes]save for revenge.[A]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Revenge, huh?[N]
I know the feeling.[AN]
[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]Still, I'm glad for your ship[N]
and your blade, Captain Ruby.[ToggleSmile][A]
[MR]
[Beat][A]
[ML]
[Beat]Though I have some things I'd[N]
like to know before we descend.[AN]
You didn't give us the full[N]
story back in the Rebel camp.[AN]
How did you learn that your[N]
[OpenQuote]Yurena" was in danger?[AN]
And what happened in your previous[N]
confrontation with House Sanz?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Let me explain.[AN]
She told me Sanz was chasing[N]
a treasure in this region,[AN]
so we trailed him down there.[AN]

parts from the Keepers, at least.[A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes]And then you'd still need[N]
to resupply the damn thing[Beat][AN]
Hah. Guess I've got myself[N]
stuck with your crew for good.[A][OpenEyes]
[MR][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[ML]
What's wrong?[A]
[MR][2LB]
[OpenEyes]It's just that even[N]
after all of this,[AN]
I still don't feel great[N]
about working with you.[AN]
I've gotten past my discomfort[N]
with piracy a long time ago,[AN]
but Captain Lua is one thing,[N]
and you're[Beat] another, I guess.[A]
[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Seems like she's made a good[N]
impression on your lot, then.[AN][ToggleSmile]
The way I see it, Lua[N]
and I aren't so different.[AN]
We both found ways of life that[N]
worked for us and our crews,[AN]
no matter what our morals or[N]
the Empire had to say about it.[A]
[MR]
That's definitely one way[N]
to look at a pirate's life.[AN]
I just[Beat] can't look past what[N]
it is we're actually doing.[A]
[ML]
And yet you've stayed[N]
on with Lua this long.[A]
[MR]
[CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes]There's one more thing[N]
I think you need to know.[AN]
It's about Yurena. We[Beat][N]
haven't seen her anywhere.[A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes]Then that means she[Beat][N]
stayed behind after all.[AN]
There's no way she could've[N]
survived something like that[Beat][AN]
but who knows what happened[N]
inside the temple once we left?[A]
[MR]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I guess all we can[N]
do is hope for the best.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Let's go, Ruby. Captain[N]
Lua is waiting for us.[A][X]

[MR][LoadBaltasar]
Ah, lord Hermenegildo?[A][N]
I had not expected to see[N]
you here, of all places.[A]
[ML]
I have gone from one[N]
misadventure to another[Beat][A][N]
[ToggleSmile]but it is truly a relief to[N]
see a friendly face at last.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MR]
Likewise.[AN]
After you vanished,[N]
we feared the worst.[A][N]
Quickly, now. Behind me. I[N]
shall bring you to safety.[A]
[ML][3LB]
You have no idea how many[N]
times I've tried to get[N]
away from these maniacs[Beat][AN]
but nobody I talked to even[N]
gave me the time of day![A]
[MR][2LB]
[CloseEyes]The skies are a dangerous[N]
place, lord Hermenegildo.[AN]
[OpenEyes]You ought to leave now, before[N]
your erstwhile crew takes notice.[A]
[ML]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]I shall at once, Baltasar.[N]
Thank you for your kindest aid![A][X]

// [ToggleRed]You don't need to reset[ToggleRed].[AN]

This is not the end of[N]
Hermenegildo's story...[A][X]

## C1_SanzHerm_Highlight
[ML][LoadHermenegildo]
[MR][LoadSanz]
[Beat]Hermenegildo?[N]
You're alive?!?[A]
[ML]
Ah, Father! [ToggleSmile]It's good to[N]
finally see you again.[ToggleSmile][AN]
It's been[Beat] years[N]
since we saw each other last,[AN]
has it not?[A]
[MR]
Since you ran away from me,[N]
and from your birthright.[AN]
Since you lost yourself[N]
in debt to a pirate gang.[A]
[ML]
I've more than learned my[N]
lesson from that folly,[AN]
as you can see from the tragic[N]
state of my[Beat] well, everything.[AN]
That maniac Captain Lua tried[N]
to make me fight with a sword![AN]
Can you believe it?[A]
[MR]
You, of all people? Mustering[N]
the courage to wield a weapon?[AN]
No, I certainly cannot.[A]
[ML]
So, ah[Beat] what now?[AN]
Those pirates are really doing[N]
a number on your-our guards,[AN]
and I, er, doubt I'd be much[N]
help in fighting them off.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Then allow me to explain.[AN]
First, you will wait here[N]
as [ToggleSmile]I scourge these plebeians[N]
off the face of the skies[ToggleSmile].[AN]
Then you will return home[N]
with me, Hermenegildo,[AN]
and we shall see to it[N]
that you face proper[N]
punishment for your misdeeds.[A]
[ML][1LB]
Punishment? I'm-[A]
[MR][MoveRight]
[R][2LB]
You think the fact that you ran[N]
away from me can be forgotten?[AN]
You think you can simply[N]
crawl back into my domain,[AN]
as though none of your[N]
escapades happened at all?[AN]
No, Hermen. That is not[N]
the way things will go.[AN]
Your betrayal of me has already[N]
placed your future beyond repair.[AN]
[Beat]Yet in my infinite generosity,[N]
I will do all that I can,[AN]
so that [ToggleSmile]Count Hermenegildo Sanz,[N]
inheritor of my treasures[ToggleSmile],[AN]
will not be a complete[N]
and utter disappointment.[A]
[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[FL][1LB]
Father, I[Beat] [CloseEyes]I[Beat][A]
[R][2LB]
Now, go within the temple.[N]
Wait by the central altar.[AN]
That is where I shall[N]
find some use for you.[A][CSSCF]
[FL][3LB]
[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes][Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes][Beat]Is that why[Beat][AN]
why I ran away from[N]
him in the first place?[AN]
Nothing I can do about[N]
it now, of course[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I had best follow his[N]
orders, so I can finally[N]
return[Beat] [CloseEyes]home[Beat][A][X]

## C1_HermYurena_Highlight

[MR]
I say! What an intimidating[N]
place Father found out here.[AN]
And whoever could be[N]
lying around in the back?[A]
[ML][LoadYurena][HalfCloseEyes]
wha[Beat] who[Beat][N]
Is that[Beat] Hermen[Beat]?[A]
[MR][MoveMidRight]
Ah, Lady Yurena![N]
Are you hurt?[AN]
I shall send for[N]
a healer at once-[A]
[ML]
Do not waste[Beat] your time.[N]
Count Sanz would send no one.[A]
[MR]
Why not? What possibly[N]
changed while I was away?[A]
[ML]
Nothing changed, truly[Beat][AN]
only that I no longer[N]
held value in his eyes.[A]
[MR]
So Father- what, he sacrificed[N]
you for the magical power here?[A]
[ML][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[MR][2LB]
[CloseEyes]I[Beat] I cannot[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll be back, Yurena. This[N]
much, you can trust in.[AN]
[HalfCloseEyes]I thought I had found a[N]
friendly face in Father[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]but perhaps I was wrong.[A][X]

## C1_Outro_HermReturns
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadHermenegildo]
[ML]
When did you get back[N]
on the ship, Hermen?[AN]
I really thought you'd[N]
slipped away for good.[A]
[MR][MoveMidRight]
[MR][3LB]
A-ah, Captain Lua! My, er, my[N]
sincerest apologies for not[N]
being present on the field.[AN]
One of Count Sanz's commanders, a[N]
knight named Baltasar, captured-[A]
[ML][2LB]
You don't need to lie.[AN]
Pilar overheard the conversation[N]
between you and that horseman.[AN]
She saw you sneak back[N]
through the mist, too.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
It didn't come as a[N]
surprise either, you know.[AN]
You've been looking for[N]
an opportunity since the[N]
day I bought your debt.[AN]
But there's one thing I still[N]
don't get about all this.[AN]
Why did you come back?[A]
[MR][2LB]
[OpenEyes]Er, it[Beat] it was[Beat][AN]
well, in the end, I just[N]
sort of[Beat][CloseEyes] changed my mind.[A]
[ML]
You [OpenQuote]changed your mind" on[N]
joining the enemy side?[A]
[MR][2LB]
[OpenEyes]I realized I didn't appreciate[N]
what I had until I left.[AN]
I certainly can't say that you[N]
and yours have been kind to me.[AN]
Rather the opposite, in fact![A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]That's certainly true.[A]
[MR][3LB]
But somehow, I've still felt[N]
better among your pirates[N]
than I have anywhere else.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Not that that's a particularly[N]
high bar for you to clear[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Still, while I was with[N]
the Skysabers, I expected[N]
Father to be[Beat] kinder.[AN]
But when I spoke to him[N]
again, I remembered just[N]
the sort of man he was.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Someone who would sacrifice[N]
even his family and friends[N]
just to enrich himself.[A]
[ML][2LB]
You mean the woman at[N]
the altar? Yurena?[AN]
[Beat]Or do you mean yourself?[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat][OpenEyes]Maybe both?[A]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]In any case. I'd[N]
like to think [ToggleSmile]I'm not[N]
quite as bad as that[ToggleSmile].[AN]
Though I wouldn't exactly[N]
consider you a [OpenQuote]friend".[A]
[MR][2LB]
And that's why I came back![AN]
No matter how awfully[N]
you choose to treat me,[AN]
you're somehow still better than[N]
everyone I've followed before.[AN]
I've made real friends here, too,[N]
and had chances to prove myself.[AN]
I'd like to not leave that behind.[AN]
[Beat]If that's alright[N]
with you, Captain Lua.[A]
[ML][2LB]
I'm not convinced you aren't[N]
just saving your own skin[Beat][AN]
but if you're sticking[N]
with us to the end,[AN]
that's all right with me.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Welcome back to the crew, Hermen.[A][X]

## C1_Outro_HermMonologues
[MR][LoadHermenegildo]
[MR]
Then that's,[N]
ah[Beat] that's it.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Father is gone for[N]
good, this time.[AN]
No longer there for me[N]
to run away from[Beat][AN]
no longer there for[N]
me to return to.[A]
[ML][LoadLua]
Hermen, you're spending an[N]
awful lot of time lingering,[AN]
instead of helping us[N]
clean up from the crash.[A]
[MR][MoveMidRight]
[MR][3LB]
[OpenEyes]Ah, Captain! I must sincerely[N]
apologize for making you wait.[AN]
I-I was just[Beat] overcome[N]
with emotion, after seeing[N]
your great victory-[A]
[ML]
You don't need to lie.[AN]
I heard what you said[N]
to Sanz at the temple.[AN]
Hard to believe that a[N]
castaway from Port Greagor[N]
has ancestry like that.[A]
[MR][2LB]
Captain Lua[Beat][AN]
On that note, I,[N]
er, I ought to ask,[AN]
does this mean that[N]
my debt is perhaps-[A]
[ML]
[Beat]Don't worry about it.[N]
You're free.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[ToggleSmile]T-truly?[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML][3LB]
When I first bought your[N]
debt, I thought it was a[N]
waste of good doubloons.[AN]
But you've more than proven your[N]
worth over these past months.[AN]
Not just as a servant, but[N]
as a member of my crew.[AN]
And now you were willing[N]
to fight your own father,[AN]
just for the sake of[N]
helping me win the day.[AN]
Do as you wish, Hermen. You've[N]
no need to follow me anymore.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[ToggleSmile]That's wonderful! Y-you have[N]
my eternal gratitude, Captain![AN]
Though given that choice, after[N]
everything I've been through[Beat][AN]
I'd like to stay on with[N]
the Skysabers after this.[A][ToggleSmile]
[ML]
Maybe you could try and-[AN]
Wait, what?[A]
[MR]
I certainly can't say that you[N]
and yours have been kind to me.[AN]
Rather the opposite, in fact![A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]That's certainly true.[A]
[MR][3LB]
But somehow, I've still felt[N]
better among your pirates[N]
than I have anywhere else.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Not that that's a particularly[N]
high bar for you to clear[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Still, I've made real friends here,[N]
and had chances to prove myself.[N]
I'd like to not leave that behind.[AN]
[Beat]If that's alright[N]
with you, Captain Lua.[A]
[ML]
Of course it is.[AN]
At this point, signing you[N]
on as a full crew member[N]
is just a formality.[AN]
If you need a tome, or[N]
anyone else's help,[N]
you know who to ask.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Welcome to the crew, Hermen.[A][X]
