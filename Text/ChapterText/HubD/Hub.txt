[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[MR]
Boss. Still picking[N]
where to fly, right?[AN]
[ML]
With the Fire Emblem, the[N]
whole sky's our oyster.[AN]
[Beat]Something's on your mind, Desi.[N]
I know you well enough to see it.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[CloseEyes]Francisca was the same[N]
way, back then. Both of[N]
you see right through me[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll just cut to the chase.[N]
I've found Rogelio. And he's real[N]
close to the course that we're on.[A]
[ML][2LB]
The traitor from your old crew?[AN]
I know you've been on his[N]
trail for a while, but[Beat][AN]
how did you manage that?[A]
[MR][3LB]
He had a contact back[N]
in the Keepers' village.[AN]
Some cowardly little man[N]
[CloseEyes]named[Beat][OpenEyes] Boru, I recall.[AN]
While we were back in town,[N]
planning our raid on the[N]
Fire Emblem's shrine[Beat][AN]
[Smile]I finally got my[N]
answers out of him.[Smile][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]Right.[AN]
Where is he, then? If that's[N]
to be our next destination.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Rogelio and his men are holed up[N]
at some desolate little rock[N]
on the edge of the skies.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Not too different from[N]
old Snowthorne, really.[AN][OpenEyes]
Folk call it the Icy Crown.[N]
Some ruin lifted up from[N]
the Lands Below long ago.[AN]
All that matters to me,[N]
though, is who's inside.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Sounds like quite the place.[AN]
I'd guess Rogelio has already[N]
cleared out any plunder that-[A]
[MR]
This isn't about treasure anymore.[AN]
We have the Fire Emblem. That's[N]
all we could ever want for loot.[AN]
No, this is about revenge.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I want that bastard dead for[N]
what he did to the Roseblades.[AN]
His face's haunted my nightmares[N]
since before I joined the Skysabers.[AN]
[OpenEyes]We have to go to the Icy Crown, Lua.[AN]
We have to make sure the Roseblades[N]
finally get to rest in peace.[A][X]

## HubD1Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
[Smile]It's been good having you[N]
as a quartermaster, Desi.[AN]
You've saved us all from[N]
disaster time and time again.[AN]
It's the least I can do to[N]
help you set things right.[A][Smile]
[MR]
Glad to hear.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Thanks, boss.[AN]
[Smile]I'm glad to be part[N]
of a crew like yours.[OpenEyes][A][Smile]
[ML]
[Smile]It's the least I can do.[AN][Smile]
I'll bring Pilar up[N]
to speed on the route,[AN]
and we'll set off for the[N]
Icy Crown as soon as we can.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[CloseEyes]Francisca[Beat][AN]
I'll bring you justice.[N]
Once and for all.[A][X]

[MR][1LB]
[Beat]What the hell, Lua?[A]
[ML][2LB]
Calm down, Desi.[AN]
I understand that this is[N]
important to you, but-[A]
[MR][MoveRight]
[R][3LB]
I've followed you through[N]
thick and thin, boss.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've gone on every job you[N]
thought was worth your time.[AN]
I even held my tongue when we[N]
worked for the damn Rebels![AN]
[OpenEyes]But what was the point,[AN]
if all that's out the[N]
window the instant I'm[N]
the one needing your help?[A]
[ML]
Damn it, Desi, you know[N]
that's not what I meant![AN]
Of course I'm fine with[N]
helping my second in command.[AN]
That's what being[N]
part of a crew is for.[AN]
It's just[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm not ready to commit[N]
to a job like this.[AN]
Not with the state the[N]
sky is in right now.[AN][OpenEyes]
We'll go after Rogelio soon.[N]
I swear it as your captain.[A]
[R][1LB]
[Beat]Right.[A] [OpenQuote]Soon."[AN]
Let's hope so, Captain Lua.[A][X]

[MR][LoadRazvan][3LB]
C-Captain! Are you still[N]
deciding on our destination?[N]
If so, I have a favor to ask.[AN]
[ML]
Hm[Beat] A favor? Rare for you[N]
to call one in, Razvan.[N]
Let me hear it before I decide.[AN]
[MR]
Right, of course. It's just that[N]
we're fairly close to my old village[Beat][N]
I want to go check on everyone, please.[AN]
[ML]
What's with the change of heart?[N]
Last time we sailed through here,[N]
you wanted to stay well away.[AN]
[MR]
That was before all the islands[N]
began falling out of the sky![AN]
But now, pandemonium's broken out,[N]
and the lowest of the low mean[N]
to take advantage of the chaos.[AN]
You've already seen that, right?[A]
[ML]
Yeah, I've seen it, alright.[AN]
Pirates and bandits plying their[N]
trade with almost no resistance[Beat][N]
Worried that they'll attack your home?[AN]
[MR]
Of course I am! In the Taklakama Desert,[N]
there's another group of famed raiders[N]
who gave us no small amount of grief.[AN]
They call themselves the Redwings[Beat][N]
They're a gang of scum that fly in[N]
and take anything they can from us.[AN]
I'm certain that they'll take this[N]
chance to do something that I[Beat][N]
That I can't allow them to do![AN]
[ML]
I understand your fears, Razvan.[N]
That said, I see several imperial[N]
ships sitting there in the port.[AN]
Don't you think that they can[N]
handle the situation themselves?[AN]
[MR]
I'm not sure. With that few of them,[N]
there can't be many soldiers here,[N]
and the Redwings are high in number.[AN]
I know this is a selfish request,[N]
but please[Beat] I'm worried about[N]
my mother and everyone else.[AN]
I won't be at ease unless I make[N]
sure the Redwings aren't a threat,[N]
personally. Please, captain![A][X]

## HubD3Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]When you say it like that,[N]
how can I say no, Razvan?[N]
We'll make port right away.[AN]
[MR]
R-Really? Thank you, captain![N]
I thought that you'd reject[N]
my request with ease[Beat][AN]
[ML]
Hm? What gave you that impression?[AN]
[MR]
I guess because[Beat] No matter how kind[N]
you may be, you're still a pirate.[N]
And pirates prioritize themselves.[AN]
Taking a risk on saving some villagers,[N]
people that you've never even met[Beat][N]
It just isn't your way, is it?[AN]
[ML]
Yeah, no doubt about that.[N]
But I have met you, haven't I?[AN]
Over this past year, you've put[N]
your life on the line to pay[N]
this "debt" you keep mentioning.[AN]
But like I said before, any debt[N]
there was is long since paid.[N]
But you've stuck around, right?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Of course. I couldn't return home,[N]
anyway. I'd only bring them trouble.[AN]
And despite not always liking our work,[N]
I do like being here, with everyone.[N]
[Beat]Do you think that I should leave?[AN]
[ML]
No. I'd never say that to you, Razvan.[AN]
It's just that, since you're still here,[N]
you're making me go into my own debt[N]
with each time you work your magic.[AN]
So[Beat] it's about time that I paid it.[N]
That's all this is. Understand?[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] Understood. Then I won't[N]
waste my breath thanking you, captain.[N]
Let's go clip those bandits' wings![A][X]

## HubD3Selection_No
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][3LB]
Sorry, but I'm against it, for now.[N]
Putting aside the risk of us sailing[N]
into a port with imperial soldiers,[AN]
how do you intend to make sure that[N]
these Redwings [OQ]aren't a threat[CQ]?[N]
Wiping them out to the last man?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]If that's what it takes, then yes.[N]
We've taken lives from people who[N]
deserved it less than they do.[AN]
[ML]
It's not about the morality of it.[AN]
But if these Redwings are as fearsome[N]
as you say, I don't see a world where[N]
we eliminate them without casualties.[AN]
It's better that we let the imperials[N]
whittle the Redwings down for a while[N]
and come later to clean up the scraps.[AN]
[MR]
Later[Beat] What if later is too late?[N]
What if my mother dies to those raids[N]
while we sail around without thought?[A]
[ML]
Sorry, Razvan, but I have to worry[N]
about everyone here, not just you.[N]
This is my decision. For now.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Fine. I won't push you anymore.[N]
I just[Beat] You said that my debt to[N]
you was clear, captain. Didn't you?[AN]
[ML]
I did, yeah. What's your point?[AN]
[MR]
Then there's nothing keeping me here,[N]
anymore. If you decide to wait too[N]
long, I'll have no choice but to leave.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You've saved us countless times over,[N]
Razvan. Whatever it is that you want to do,[N]
I won't try to stop you from doing it.[AN]
But[Beat] I'll miss you if you leave, kid.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[Beat]And I would miss you too, captain.[N]
So please, don't make me wait long.[N]
Otherwise, I really will[Beat][A][X]

## HubDBeginningScene1
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Alright, it looks like everyone's here.[N]
Let's begin the meeting, shall we?[AN]
Ah, but before we get started,[N]
good work getting us out of that[N]
hellhole, Pilar. Thanks, seriously.[AN]
[ML][LoadPilar]
I have no need for thanks.[AN]
With my knowledge of the winds,[N]
even escaping the Keepers' village[N]
is little more than child's play.[AN]
[MR]
Still, we really do owe you[Beat][N]
For that, and for helping us[N]
steal the Fire Emblem, too.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][CF][LoadOrlando]
Hahaha, indeed! Excellent work, Pilar.[N]
Your experience with those Keepers[N]
made our grand heist possible.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Orlando, you should really keep your[N]
mouth shut about this. You're the one[N]
who pushed us into this, and yet,[AN]
you didn't say a thing about what[N]
might happen in the aftermath.[N]
The islands are dropping, Orlando![AN]
[ML]
Now, now, Lua. How could I know?[N]
It was merely a legend, after all.[AN]
For all I knew, the Fire Emblem[N]
could have not existed, at all[Beat][N]
But here it is, in our grasp![AN]
I only wish that I could use it[N]
myself[Beat] But it appears that[N]
it has thoroughly bonded to you.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadPilar]
Indeed. Unfortunately, what that[N]
means is that Quispe will come[N]
after us, so long as Lua lives.[AN]
Or perhaps, until the islands[N]
finish falling, at least[Beat][AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadRazvan]
About that[Beat] All of this has me[N]
worried, captain. How is everyone[N]
taking the descent of the islands?[AN]
I fear that it could contribute[N]
to increased chaos and confusion[Beat][N]
I hope that my mother is safe.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I'm sure that she is, Razvan.[N]
Still, you make a good point[Beat][AN]
We should get an idea of how[N]
everyone's taking current events.[N]
It could be valuable information.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadDesiderio]
Mm. Makes sense to take a breather,[N]
yeah. 'Sides, I've got business[N]
to settle back in the outskirts.[AN]
I don't know about the rest of ya,[N]
but I wanna get this done while I can.[AN]
With us havin' the Fire Emblem and all,[N]
who knows how long it'll be before[N]
trouble comes knockin' on our door?[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadRahel]
Yeah, Desi's got the right of it.[N]
If it's okay, I wanna check out[N]
Port Greagor and see how Ida's doing.[AN]
So[Beat] if we can swing by that part[N]
of the outskirts, I'd be grateful.[AN]
[MR]
It's not often that you ask something[N]
like that[Beat] Sure, we can head there.[AN]
I can't say when we'll be able to spare[N]
time for both of your requests,[N]
but I'll try to make time for it.[AN]
In the meantime, I'd like to stick[N]
around that area, gather info and[N]
weapons, and prepare for a fight.[AN]
A big one, not like those tussles[N]
in the Keepers' village[Beat] With[N]
the Fire Emblem, it's when, not if.[AN]
[FL][LoadPilar]
[L][LoadDesiderio]
Heh! Sounds good to me, boss.[N]
And I'm always down for a brawl,[N]
so put me in the plannin' party![AN]
[FL]
I suppose we may have no choice[Beat][N]
Let's gather our bearings, first,[N]
and see how Incendivis has reacted.[AN]
[CSS][FL][CF][L][CF]
[FL][LoadRahel]
Keeping watch on the empire's good[N]
and all, but Ida's my top priority.[N]
She's done a lot for me, y'know[Beat][AN]
[L][LoadRazvan]
I'd like to check on my mother, too.[N]
That, and to save as many people as[N]
possible from the coming calamity[Beat][A]
[CSS][FL][CF][L][CF]
[ML][LoadOrlando]
A calamity, hm? Perhaps it is,[N]
but viewed from another angle,[N]
it may yet be a blessing.[AN]
Regardless, we will soon become[N]
the most hunted pirate crew[N]
across Incendivis's skies.[AN]
[Beat]How are you feeling, Lua?[N]
Do you regret setting out on this[N]
journey to find the Fire Emblem?[A]
[MR]
Regret?[ToggleSmile] No, I don't regret it at all.[N]
This adventure's been everything that[N]
you said it would be, and more.[AN]
Compare it to preying on small-time[N]
merchants, like I was before, and[Beat][N]
Well, there's really no competition.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'm glad to hear you say that.[N]
With that settled, let me say this:[N]
our lot in life may yet change still.[AN]
Perhaps you will have no choice but[N]
to make a decision that you may regret[Beat][AN]
Even so, I will stand by your side, Lua.[N]
I will see this journey to its end,[N]
no matter what result awaits us.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Heh. You damn well better, old man.[N]
Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.[N]
You're all dismissed[Beat] Except Rahel.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadRahel]
Huh, me? Alright, I guess.[A][X]

## HubDBeginningScene2
[ML][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
So, how's the ship looking, Rahel?[N]
Anything out of place or missing?[AN]
[ML]
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot, captain.[N]
I finished my inspection of the ship[N]
today, and honestly, it's solid.[AN]
Could use some repairs and tweaks,[N]
but I can't complain about much[N]
besides the cannons, really.[AN]
[MR]
Hm? What's wrong with the cannons?[AN]
[ML]
Just don't work, is all.[N]
They look pretty high-class, though[Beat][N]
Maybe this was an Incendivis galleon?[AN]
[MR]
Based on the ship's structure,[N]
that was my assumption, too. Hm[Beat][N]
Prioritize fixing those cannons, Rahel.[AN]
We might need them sooner than we think.[AN]
[ML]
Saying that's a bad omen, captain[Beat][AN]
But alright, I'll fix 'em up til[N]
they're something to be proud of.[N]
Just give me some time, alright?[A]
[MR]
Sure, sure. We've got plenty of it,[N]
so get them good and shiny, Rahel.[N]
I want them looking grand, understand?[AN]
[ML]
Ha[Beat] Get somebody else to do that crap.[N]
Anyway, I'll let you know when they're[N]
ready to go. Til then? Leave me alone![A]
[CSS][ML][CF]
[MR]
Snippy, snippy[Beat] She really must[N]
be worried about Ida, after all.[AN]
Maybe Port Greagor'll be our[N]
first destination, after all[Beat][N]
I'll have to think it over.[AN][X]

## HubDArmadaExplanation
Just as in Hub B, Lua can speak with[N]
the crew on the ship and switch to[N]
sailing the outskirts via green tiles.[A][X]

## HubDEndingScene1
[R][LoadLua][3LB]
Alright, that's about everything[N]
settled[Beat] Maybe I can kick my[N]
feet up for a bit and just relax-[AN]
[FFL][LoadPilar]
Sounds nice. Unfortunately,[N]
dreams will have to wait, Lua.[AN]
[FFL][MoveLeft][L]
I received a report from our scouts.[N]
It seems that an imperial armada[N]
heads towards us, as we speak.[AN]
[R]
Ugh[Beat] They must want the Fire Emblem.[N]
Alright, then. Let's move south until[N]
we find a good spot to sink those-[AN]
[FFL][LoadRazvan][MoveFarLeft][FL]
E-Er, captain! I have bad news![AN]
I saw a group of ships that look[N]
similar to ours, to the southeast![N]
They're probably Keepers, right?[AN]
[R]
Based on that description, yeah.[N]
They really had to come at the[N]
same time as the empire? [Beat]Damn.[AN]
Well, maybe we can sail towards[N]
Port Greagor and look for an[N]
island where we can lay low?[AN]
[FFL][LoadDesiderio]
Ain't no way that's happenin',[N]
boss. Unless you wanna sink?[AN]
[FFL][MoveFarRight][FR][CF][FR][LoadDesiderio]
Wanna guess who's lyin' in wait?[AN]
Alonso and his band of lowlives,[N]
along with a buncha other pirates.[N]
They're closin' in real quick, boss.[AN]
[R]
Seriously? Half the sky's on our ass![AN]
If that's the situation, then I don't[N]
see any way to wriggle out of this[Beat][N]
We might have to fight our way out.[AN]
Desiderio, get messages out to each[N]
of these groups that we want to parley.[N]
The meeting place[Beat] How about Skullrock?[AN]
[FR]
That island by Port Greagor? You got it.[N]
How about I tell 'em that if they don't,[N]
we'll blow 'em all out of the sky?[AN]
[R]
Good idea. The cannons aren't ready[Beat][AN]
But none of the guys hunting us[N]
will know that. It'll get them[N]
to the negotiating table, at least.[AN]
[FR]
Yep. I'll handle all that and tell[N]
the rest of the crew what's up.[N]
Gotta get 'em ready to fight![AN]
[CSS][FR][CF]
[FL]
He almost sounds happy about that[Beat][AN]
It looks like I should review our[N]
stock of healing supplies and staves.[N]
If a fight comes[Beat] We'll need them.[AN]
[R]
Sounds good. Make sure the other[N]
healers know the score, too.[AN]
We'll be counting on you guys[N]
to get us out of this mess alive[Beat][N]
Our lives are in your hands, Razvan.[AN]
[FL]
R-Right[Beat] I won't let you down![A]
[CSS][FL][CF]
[L]
Hm[Beat] If the battle becomes necessary,[N]
so be it. Still, if it's Skullrock[Beat][N]
Yes, perhaps there's another way.[AN]
[R]
Pilar? What are you talking about?[AN]
[L]
A way to escape an all-out fight.[AN]
With the right weather conditions[N]
and winds[Beat] We could flee and[N]
leave them behind, for a while.[AN]
[R]
Sounds like it could be useful[Beat][AN]
I'll leave the details to you.[N]
You're the only one who can come[N]
up with a plan like this, Pilar.[N]
[L][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] Right you are, Lua.[N]
The only one crazy enough.[A]
[CSS][L][CF][ToggleSmile]
[R]
Uh, I don't like the sound of that[Beat][N]
Hm? Who's knocking on the door?[N]
Can't they tell that I'm busy here?[AN]
Ugh[Beat] They won't stop! Who the hell-[A][X]

## HubDEndingScene2
[FL][LoadRahel]
[L][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Orlando and Rahel? Fine, come in. Just[Beat][N]
Don't tell me there are more ships.[N]
I don't think my heart can take it.[AN]
[L]
No, no. I heard about the situation[N]
from Desiderio's endless shouting,[N]
you see, and came as soon as I could.[AN]
[FL]
And he dragged me with him[Beat][N]
Damn, old coot. I was busy![AN]
[L]
In any case, you can count on us![N]
Even in my exile, I retain [OQ]favors[CQ][N]
that I can call in from the merchantry.[AN]
If our crew has a need for more arms[N]
or other necessary goods, I swear[N]
to procure them for wholesale price[Beat][AN]
But believe me when I say that[N]
I expect proper recompense,[N]
when this matter is over.[AN]
[MR]
Yeah, yeah, you always do[Beat][AN]
Still, I'll take you up on that,[N]
Orlando. We'll need every edge that[N]
we can get, if we're forced to fight.[AN]
[L]
Right you are! Then allow me[N]
to bid you adieu, my captain.[N]
I have some palms to grease[Beat][A]
[CSS][L][CF]
[FL]
Hmph[Beat] Well, I needed to speak with[N]
you anyway, captain. Those cannons[N]
you asked about? Pretty much done.[AN]
Still got some finetuning to do,[N]
but by the time we're set to brawl,[N]
they'll be locked and loaded. Trust me.[AN]
[MR]
Good to know. I'll have a use for them[N]
even before a proper fight breaks out,[N]
so prioritize getting them up to speed.[AN]
[FL]
Always pushing for more, aren't ya?[AN]
Look, I'll get 'em ready as soon[N]
as I can. Just leave me alone, and[N]
make sure that Orlando does, too![A]
[CSS][FL][CF]
[MR]
Heh[Beat] Needs her focus, huh?[AN]
She must really be into it.[N]
Hell, the whole crew's hustling[N]
and bustling about the fight ahead.[AN]
Guess all that's left is for me to[N]
do my part. I'll handle all the[N]
odds and ends that need doing[Beat][AN]
And then, all that's left is to[N]
sail to the meeting spot so that[N]
we can meet our [OQ]friends[CQ].[AN][X]

## HubDSayWhereToGo
Now that all missions in the outskirts[N]
have been completed, Lua will now make[N]
course for the final confrontation.[AN]
Follow the new green tiles on the[N]
central island while sailing as[N]
the Liberator, and Hub D will end.[A][X]
