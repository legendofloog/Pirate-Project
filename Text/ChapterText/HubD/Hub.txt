[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[MR]
Boss. Still picking[N]
where to fly, right?[AN]
[ML]
With the Fire Emblem, the[N]
whole sky's our oyster.[AN]
[Beat]Something's on your mind, Desi.[N]
I know you well enough to see it.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[CloseEyes]Francisca was the same[N]
way, back then. Both of[N]
you see right through me[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll just cut to the chase.[N]
I've found Rogelio. And he's real[N]
close to the course that we're on.[A]
[ML][2LB]
The traitor from your old crew?[AN]
I know you've been on his[N]
trail for a while, but[Beat][AN]
how did you manage that?[A]
[MR][3LB]
He had a contact back[N]
in the Keepers' village.[AN]
Some cowardly little man[N]
[CloseEyes]named[Beat][OpenEyes] Boru, I recall.[AN]
While we were back in town,[N]
planning our raid on the[N]
Fire Emblem's shrine[Beat][AN]
[Smile]I finally got my[N]
answers out of him.[Smile][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]Right.[AN]
Where is he, then? If that's[N]
to be our next destination.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Rogelio and his men are holed up[N]
at some desolate little rock[N]
on the edge of the skies.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Not too different from[N]
old Snowthorne, really.[AN][OpenEyes]
Folk call it the Icy Crown.[N]
Some ruin lifted up from[N]
the Lands Below long ago.[AN]
All that matters to me,[N]
though, is who's inside.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Sounds like quite the place.[AN]
I'd guess Rogelio has already[N]
cleared out any plunder that-[A]
[MR]
This isn't about treasure anymore.[AN]
We have the Fire Emblem. That's[N]
all we could ever want for loot.[AN]
No, this is about revenge.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I want that bastard dead for[N]
what he did to the Roseblades.[AN]
His face's haunted my nightmares[N]
since before I joined the Skysabers.[AN]
[OpenEyes]We have to go to the Icy Crown, Lua.[AN]
We have to make sure the Roseblades[N]
finally get to rest in peace.[A][X]

## HubD1Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
[Smile]It's been good having you[N]
as a quartermaster, Desi.[AN]
You've saved us all from[N]
disaster time and time again.[AN]
It's the least I can do to[N]
help you set things right.[A][Smile]
[MR]
Glad to hear.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Thanks, boss.[AN]
[Smile]I'm glad to be part[N]
of a crew like yours.[OpenEyes][A][Smile]
[ML]
[Smile]It's the least I can do.[AN][Smile]
I'll bring Pilar up[N]
to speed on the route,[AN]
and we'll set off for the[N]
Icy Crown as soon as we can.[A][CSSCF]

Calm down, Desi.[AN]
I understand that this is[N]
important to you, but-[A]
[MR][MoveRight]
[R][3LB]
I've followed you through[N]
thick and thin, boss.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've gone on every job you[N]
thought was worth your time.[AN]
I even held my tongue when we[N]
worked for the damn Rebels![AN]
[OpenEyes]But what was the point,[AN]
if all that's out the[N]
window the instant I'm[N]
the one needing your help?[A]
[ML]
Damn it, Desi, you know[N]
that's not what I meant![AN]
Of course I'm fine with[N]
helping my second in command.[AN]
That's what being[N]
part of a crew is for.[AN]
It's just[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm not ready to commit[N]
to a job like this.[AN]
Not with the state the[N]
sky is in right now.[AN][OpenEyes]
We'll go after Rogelio soon.[N]
I swear it as your captain.[A]
[R][1LB]

[MR][LoadRazvan][3LB]
C-Captain! Are you still[N]
deciding on our destination?[N]
If so, I have a favor to ask.[AN]
[ML]
Hm[Beat] A favor? Rare for you[N]
to call one in, Razvan.[N]
Let me hear it before I decide.[AN]
[MR]
Right, of course. It's just that[N]
we're fairly close to my old village[Beat][N]
I want to go check on everyone, please.[AN]
[ML]
What's with the change of heart?[N]
Last time we sailed through here,[N]
you wanted to stay well away.[AN]
[MR]
That was before all the islands[N]
began falling out of the sky![AN]
But now, pandemonium's broken out,[N]
and the lowest of the low mean[N]
to take advantage of the chaos.[AN]
You've already seen that, right?[A]
[ML]
Yeah, I've seen it, alright.[AN]
Pirates and bandits plying their[N]
trade with almost no resistance[Beat][N]
Worried that they'll attack your home?[AN]
[MR]
Of course I am! In the Taklakama Desert,[N]
there's another group of famed raiders[N]
who gave us no small amount of grief.[AN]
They call themselves the Redwings[Beat][N]
They're a gang of scum that fly in[N]
and take anything they can from us.[AN]
I'm certain that they'll take this[N]
chance to do something that I[Beat][N]
That I can't allow them to do![AN]
[ML]
I understand your fears, Razvan.[N]
That said, I see several imperial[N]
ships sitting there in the port.[AN]
Don't you think that they can[N]
handle the situation themselves?[AN]
[MR]
I'm not sure. With that few of them,[N]
there can't be many soldiers here,[N]
and the Redwings are high in number.[AN]
I know this is a selfish request,[N]
but please[Beat] I'm worried about[N]
my mother and everyone else.[AN]
I won't be at ease unless I make[N]
sure the Redwings aren't a threat,[N]
personally. Please, captain![A][X]

## HubD3Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]When you say it like that,[N]
how can I say no, Razvan?[N]
We'll make port right away.[AN]
[MR]
R-Really? Thank you, captain![N]
I thought that you'd reject[N]
my request with ease[Beat][AN]
[ML]
Hm? What gave you that impression?[AN]
[MR]
I guess because[Beat] No matter how kind[N]
you may be, you're still a pirate.[N]
And pirates prioritize themselves.[AN]
Taking a risk on saving some villagers,[N]
people that you've never even met[Beat][N]
It just isn't your way, is it?[AN]
[ML]
Yeah, no doubt about that.[N]
But I have met you, haven't I?[AN]
Over this past year, you've put[N]
your life on the line to pay[N]
this "debt" you keep mentioning.[AN]
But like I said before, any debt[N]
there was is long since paid.[N]
But you've stuck around, right?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Of course. I couldn't return home,[N]
anyway. I'd only bring them trouble.[AN]
And despite not always liking our work,[N]
I do like being here, with everyone.[N]
[Beat]Do you think that I should leave?[AN]
[ML]
No. I'd never say that to you, Razvan.[AN]
It's just that, since you're still here,[N]
you're making me go into my own debt[N]
with each time you work your magic.[AN]
So[Beat] it's about time that I paid it.[N]
That's all this is. Understand?[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] Understood. Then I won't[N]
waste my breath thanking you, captain.[N]
Let's go clip those bandits' wings![A][X]

## HubD3Selection_No
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][3LB]
Sorry, but I'm against it, for now.[N]
Putting aside the risk of us sailing[N]
into a port with imperial soldiers,[AN]
how do you intend to make sure that[N]
these Redwings [OQ]aren't a threat[CQ]?[N]
Wiping them out to the last man?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]If that's what it takes, then yes.[N]
We've taken lives from people who[N]
deserved it less than they do.[AN]
[ML]
It's not about the morality of it.[AN]
But if these Redwings are as fearsome[N]
as you say, I don't see a world where[N]
we eliminate them without casualties.[AN]
It's better that we let the imperials[N]
whittle the Redwings down for a while[N]
and come later to clean up the scraps.[AN]
[MR]
Later[Beat] What if later is too late?[N]
What if my mother dies to those raids[N]
while we sail around without thought?[A]
[ML]
Sorry, Razvan, but I have to worry[N]
about everyone here, not just you.[N]
This is my decision. For now.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Fine. I won't push you anymore.[N]
I just[Beat] You said that my debt to[N]
you was clear, captain. Didn't you?[AN]
[ML]
I did, yeah. What's your point?[AN]
[MR]
Then there's nothing keeping me here,[N]
anymore. If you decide to wait too[N]
long, I'll have no choice but to leave.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You've saved us countless times over,[N]
Razvan. Whatever it is that you want to do,[N]
I won't try to stop you from doing it.[AN]
But[Beat] I'll miss you if you leave, kid.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[Beat]And I would miss you too, captain.[N]
So please, don't make me wait long.[N]
Otherwise, I really will[Beat][A][X]

[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Alright, it looks like everyone's here.[N]
Let's begin the meeting, shall we?[AN]
Ah, but before we get started,[N]
good work getting us out of that[N]
hellhole, Pilar. Thanks, seriously.[AN]
[ML][LoadPilar]
I have no need for thanks.[AN]
With my knowledge of the winds,[N]
even escaping the Keepers' village[N]
is little more than child's play.[AN]
[MR]
Still, we really do owe you[Beat][N]
For that, and for helping us[N]
steal the Fire Emblem, too.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][CF][LoadOrlando]
Hahaha, indeed! Excellent work, Pilar.[N]
Your experience with those Keepers[N]
made our grand heist possible.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Orlando, you should really keep your[N]
mouth shut about this. You're the one[N]
who pushed us into this, and yet,[AN]
you didn't say a thing about what[N]
might happen in the aftermath.[N]
The islands are dropping, Orlando![AN]
[ML]
Now, now, Lua. How could I know?[N]
It was merely a legend, after all.[AN]
For all I knew, the Fire Emblem[N]
could have not existed, at all[Beat][N]
But here it is, in our grasp![AN]
I only wish that I could use it[N]
myself[Beat] But it appears that[N]
it has thoroughly bonded to you.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadPilar]
Indeed. Unfortunately, what that[N]
means is that Quispe will come[N]
after us, so long as Lua lives.[AN]
Or perhaps, until the islands[N]
finish falling, at least[Beat][AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadRazvan]
About that[Beat] All of this has me[N]
worried, captain. How is everyone[N]
taking the descent of the islands?[AN]
I fear that it could contribute[N]
to increased chaos and confusion[Beat][N]
I hope that my mother is safe.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I'm sure that she is, Razvan.[N]
Still, you make a good point[Beat][AN]
We should get an idea of how[N]
everyone's taking current events.[N]
It could be valuable information.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadDesiderio]
Mm. Makes sense to take a breather,[N]
yeah. 'Sides, I've got business[N]
to settle back in the outskirts.[AN]
I don't know about the rest of ya,[N]
but I wanna get this done while I can.[AN]
With us havin' the Fire Emblem and all,[N]
who knows how long it'll be before[N]
trouble comes knockin' on our door?[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadRahel]
Yeah, Desi's got the right of it.[N]
If it's okay, I wanna check out[N]
Port Greagor and see how Ida's doing.[AN]
So[Beat] if we can swing by that part[N]
of the outskirts, I'd be grateful.[AN]
[MR]
It's not often that you ask something[N]
like that[Beat] Sure, we can head there.[AN]
I can't say when we'll be able to spare[N]
time for both of your requests,[N]
but I'll try to make time for it.[AN]
In the meantime, I'd like to stick[N]
around that area, gather info and[N]
weapons, and prepare for a fight.[AN]
A big one, not like those tussles[N]
in the Keepers' village[Beat] With[N]
the Fire Emblem, it's when, not if.[AN]
[FL][LoadPilar]
[L][LoadDesiderio]
Heh! Sounds good to me, boss.[N]
And I'm always down for a brawl,[N]
so put me in the plannin' party![AN]
[FL]
I suppose we may have no choice[Beat][N]
Let's gather our bearings, first,[N]
and see how Incendivis has reacted.[AN]
[CSS][FL][CF][L][CF]
[FL][LoadRahel]
Keeping watch on the empire's good[N]
and all, but Ida's my top priority.[N]
She's done a lot for me, y'know[Beat][AN]
[L][LoadRazvan]
I'd like to check on my mother, too.[N]
That, and to save as many people as[N]
possible from the coming calamity[Beat][A]
[CSS][FL][CF][L][CF]
[ML][LoadOrlando]
A calamity, hm? Perhaps it is,[N]
but viewed from another angle,[N]
it may yet be a blessing.[AN]
Regardless, we will soon become[N]
the most hunted pirate crew[N]
across Incendivis's skies.[AN]
[Beat]How are you feeling, Lua?[N]
Do you regret setting out on this[N]
journey to find the Fire Emblem?[A]
[MR]
Regret?[ToggleSmile] No, I don't regret it at all.[N]
This adventure's been everything that[N]
you said it would be, and more.[AN]
Compare it to preying on small-time[N]
merchants, like I was before, and[Beat][N]
Well, there's really no competition.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]I'm glad to hear you say that.[N]
With that settled, let me say this:[N]
our lot in life may yet change still.[AN]
Perhaps you will have no choice but[N]
to make a decision that you may regret[Beat][AN]
Even so, I will stand by your side, Lua.[N]
I will see this journey to its end,[N]
no matter what result awaits us.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Heh. You damn well better, old man.[N]
Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.[N]
You're all dismissed[Beat] Except Rahel.[AN]
[CSS][ML][CF][LoadRahel]
Huh, me? Alright, I guess.[A][X]

## HubDBeginningScene2
[ML][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
So, how's the ship looking, Rahel?[N]
Anything out of place or missing?[AN]
[ML]
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot, captain.[N]
I finished my inspection of the ship[N]
today, and honestly, it's solid.[AN]
Could use some repairs and tweaks,[N]
but I can't complain about much[N]
besides the cannons, really.[AN]
[MR]
Hm? What's wrong with the cannons?[AN]
[ML]
Just don't work, is all.[N]
They look pretty high-class, though[Beat][N]
Maybe this was an Incendivis galleon?[AN]
[MR]
Based on the ship's structure,[N]
that was my assumption, too. Hm[Beat][N]
Prioritize fixing those cannons, Rahel.[AN]
We might need them sooner than we think.[AN]
[ML]
Saying that's a bad omen, captain[Beat][AN]
But alright, I'll fix 'em up til[N]
they're something to be proud of.[N]
Just give me some time, alright?[A]
[MR]
Sure, sure. We've got plenty of it,[N]
so get them good and shiny, Rahel.[N]
I want them looking grand, understand?[AN]
[ML]
Ha[Beat] Get somebody else to do that crap.[N]
Anyway, I'll let you know when they're[N]
ready to go. Til then? Leave me alone![A]
[CSS][ML][CF]
[MR]
Snippy, snippy[Beat] She really must[N]
be worried about Ida, after all.[AN]
Maybe Port Greagor'll be our[N]
first destination, after all[Beat][N]
I'll have to think it over.[AN][X]

## HubDArmadaExplanation
Just as in Hub B, Lua can speak with[N]
the crew on the ship and switch to[N]
sailing the outskirts via green tiles.[A][X]

## HubDEndingScene1
[R][LoadLua][3LB]
Alright, that's about everything[N]
settled[Beat] Maybe I can kick my[N]
feet up for a bit and just relax-[AN]
[FFL][LoadPilar]
Sounds nice. Unfortunately,[N]
dreams will have to wait, Lua.[AN]
[FFL][MoveLeft][L]
I received a report from our scouts.[N]
It seems that an imperial armada[N]
heads towards us, as we speak.[AN]
[R]
Ugh[Beat] They must want the Fire Emblem.[N]
Alright, then. Let's move south until[N]
we find a good spot to sink those-[AN]
[FFL][LoadRazvan][MoveFarLeft][FL]
E-Er, captain! I have bad news![AN]
I saw a group of ships that look[N]
similar to ours, to the southeast![N]
They're probably Keepers, right?[AN]
[R]
Based on that description, yeah.[N]
They really had to come at the[N]
same time as the empire? [Beat]Damn.[AN]
Well, maybe we can sail towards[N]
Port Greagor and look for an[N]
island where we can lay low?[AN]
[FFL][LoadDesiderio]
Ain't no way that's happenin',[N]
boss. Unless you wanna sink?[AN]
[FFL][MoveFarRight][FR][CF][FR][LoadDesiderio]
Wanna guess who's lyin' in wait?[AN]
Alonso and his band of lowlives,[N]
along with a buncha other pirates.[N]
They're closin' in real quick, boss.[AN]
[R]
Seriously? Half the sky's on our ass![AN]
If that's the situation, then I don't[N]
see any way to wriggle out of this[Beat][N]
We might have to fight our way out.[AN]
Desiderio, get messages out to each[N]
of these groups that we want to parley.[N]
The meeting place[Beat] How about Skullrock?[AN]
[FR]
That island by Port Greagor? You got it.[N]
How about I tell 'em that if they don't,[N]
we'll blow 'em all out of the sky?[AN]
[R]
Good idea. The cannons aren't ready[Beat][AN]
But none of the guys hunting us[N]
will know that. It'll get them[N]
to the negotiating table, at least.[AN]
[FR]
Yep. I'll handle all that and tell[N]
the rest of the crew what's up.[N]
Gotta get 'em ready to fight![AN]
[CSS][FR][CF]
[FL]
He almost sounds happy about that[Beat][AN]
It looks like I should review our[N]
stock of healing supplies and staves.[N]
If a fight comes[Beat] We'll need them.[AN]
[R]
Sounds good. Make sure the other[N]
healers know the score, too.[AN]
We'll be counting on you guys[N]
to get us out of this mess alive[Beat][N]
Our lives are in your hands, Razvan.[AN]
[FL]
R-Right[Beat] I won't let you down![A]
[CSS][FL][CF]
[L]
Hm[Beat] If the battle becomes necessary,[N]
so be it. Still, if it's Skullrock[Beat][N]
Yes, perhaps there's another way.[AN]
[R]
Pilar? What are you talking about?[AN]
[L]
A way to escape an all-out fight.[AN]
With the right weather conditions[N]
and winds[Beat] We could flee and[N]
leave them behind, for a while.[AN]
[R]
Sounds like it could be useful[Beat][AN]
I'll leave the details to you.[N]
You're the only one who can come[N]
up with a plan like this, Pilar.[N]
[L][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] Right you are, Lua.[N]
The only one crazy enough.[A]
[CSS][L][CF][ToggleSmile]
[R]
Uh, I don't like the sound of that[Beat][N]
Hm? Who's knocking on the door?[N]
Can't they tell that I'm busy here?[AN]
Ugh[Beat] They won't stop! Who the hell-[A][X]

## HubDEndingScene2

[L][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Orlando and Rahel? Fine, come in. Just[Beat][N]
Don't tell me there are more ships.[N]
I don't think my heart can take it.[AN]
[L]
No, no. I heard about the situation[N]
from Desiderio's endless shouting,[N]
you see, and came as soon as I could.[AN]
[FL]
And he dragged me with him[Beat][N]
Damn, old coot. I was busy![AN]
[L]
In any case, you can count on us![N]
Even in my exile, I retain [OQ]favors[CQ][N]
that I can call in from the merchantry.[AN]
If our crew has a need for more arms[N]
or other necessary goods, I swear[N]
to procure them for wholesale price[Beat][AN]
But believe me when I say that[N]
I expect proper recompense,[N]
when this matter is over.[AN]
[MR]
Yeah, yeah, you always do[Beat][AN]
Still, I'll take you up on that,[N]
Orlando. We'll need every edge that[N]
we can get, if we're forced to fight.[AN]
[L]
Right you are! Then allow me[N]
to bid you adieu, my captain.[N]
I have some palms to grease[Beat][A]
[CSS][L][CF]
[FL]
Hmph[Beat] Well, I needed to speak with[N]
you anyway, captain. Those cannons[N]
you asked about? Pretty much done.[AN]
Still got some finetuning to do,[N]
but by the time we're set to brawl,[N]
they'll be locked and loaded. Trust me.[AN]
[MR]
Good to know. I'll have a use for them[N]
even before a proper fight breaks out,[N]
so prioritize getting them up to speed.[AN]
[FL]
Always pushing for more, aren't ya?[AN]
Look, I'll get 'em ready as soon[N]
as I can. Just leave me alone, and[N]
make sure that Orlando does, too![A]
[CSS][FL][CF]
[MR]
Heh[Beat] Needs her focus, huh?[AN]
She must really be into it.[N]
Hell, the whole crew's hustling[N]
and bustling about the fight ahead.[AN]
Guess all that's left is for me to[N]
do my part. I'll handle all the[N]
odds and ends that need doing[Beat][AN]
And then, all that's left is to[N]
sail to the meeting spot so that[N]
we can meet our [OQ]friends[CQ].[AN][X]

## HubDSayWhereToGo
Now that all missions in the outskirts[N]
have been completed, Lua will now make[N]
course for the final confrontation.[AN]
Follow the new green tiles on the[N]
central island while sailing as[N]
the Arbitrator, and Hub D will end.[A][X]

Well, my debt is paid, my boy.[N]

Hardly a worthy task, for one such as I.[AN]
[FL]
You little[Beat] That's why your sections[N]
of the boat were always a damn mess![N]
Hey, I told you, captain! I told you![AN]
[FR]
That you did, Ximo. That you did.[N]
Don't worry, though. I've been[N]
docking Carmen's pay this whole time.[AN]
She didn't get a single doubloon[N]
that she didn't earn. Trust me.[A]
[L]
H-Huh? How could you be so cruel?[AN]
I thought that everyone could afford[N]
little more than a new tome, but[Beat][N]
This is theft, captain! Theft![AN]
[FR]
You realize we're pirates, right?[N]
Besides, you stole from me, first,[N]
by slacking off on the job.[AN]
[L]
Ngh[Beat] Have I not proven myself[N]
worthy of more pay, captain?[N]
You praised me, the other day![AN]
[FR]
Praise? I only remember saying[N]
that you weren't out of tune[Beat][N]
But yeah, you'll get more pay.[AN]
You all will, going forward.[N]
You've stuck by me since near[N]
the start[Beat] and grown, so much.[A]
[R]
Captain[Beat] I almost forgive you,[N]
for making me dance for your amusement.[N]
How[Beat] sniff[Beat] How touching, truly![AN]
[FL]
Heh! Come on, man. Keep it together.[N]
Still, I gotta say, I feel the same way.[AN]
Everyone back home thought that I'd[N]
never make it[Beat] That I'd never be worth[N]
anything to anyone. But you did, captain.[AN]
[L]
Come now, Ximo. No need to[Beat] to[Beat][A][CloseEyes]
[FR]
What, you're crying too?[A]
[L][OpenEyes]
N-No, I'm not! I just[Beat] I had nowhere[N]
to go, and the captain took me in.[AN]
She let me sing and play music,[N]
even though my own family would[N]
castigate me whenever I tried.[AN]
Well, you all gave me your fair share[N]
of grief, too[Beat] But you never stopped[N]
me, and you always listened, and[Beat][AN]
And that meant more than anything.[AN]
[R]
Oh, the dust in my eyes, it just[Beat][N]
It won't relent, no matter what I do![N]
Ah, how confounding! How vexing![A]
[FR]
Ha[Beat] It really is a mystery, isn't it?[AN]
Well, take as much time as you need[N]
to get that dust out, Hermen, Carmen.[N]
And this goes for you, too, Ximo:[AN]
I[Beat] I'm proud of you. All of you.[N]
And I'll be relying on you,[N]
in the days and years to come[Beat][AN]
So keep up the good work.[A][CSSCF]

[L][LoadJaime]
[R][LoadWindy]
[FR][LoadLua]
[L][3LB]
Hey! How's it going, captain?[A]
[FR]
Besides the islands falling?[N]
No complaints, I guess.[N]
What's Windy doing with you?[AN]
[FL]
She's one of the few real rebels[N]
that we have, on this ship.[N]
I thought to ask her some questions.[AN]
[FR]
We didn't get much time to press[N]
the other Keepers on their beliefs,[N]
so I'd like to hear Windy's answers, too.[AN]
[R]
Uh huh[Beat] Just so you know,[N]
rebel really isn't the right word.[N]
It's more like[Beat] free thinker?[AN]
[FR]
That so? Elaborate.[AN]
[R]
Well, sure. It's kinda like this.[N]
The whole point of being a Keeper[N]
is holding onto the old ways, right?[AN]
The ones before we rose to the sky.[N]
From what I've heard about Incendivis,[N]
they're a far cry from modern laws.[AN]
[L]
Damn right. In the empire,[N]
it's all about who you know.[N]
What your family's name is.[AN]
How much gold you've got,[N]
and how much you're willing[N]
to spend on bribing officials.[AN]
[R]
In the village, we don't take gold[N]
from anybody except outsiders,[N]
and we use it just to buy more food.[AN]
Nobody except the chief stands above[N]
anyone else, and the chief's chosen[N]
by every adult in the village.[AN]
The chief gives out veggies and[N]
grains and stuff to everybody,[N]
depending on how much they need.[AN]
[FL]
So no one will ever starve, unlike[N]
Incendivis[Beat] Is that all free?[N]
Or is there some kind of catch?[AN]
[R]
Well, I didn't need to do anything[N]
but train under some other Keepers,[N]
but the adults have to work for it.[AN]
The chief gives 'em some options,[N]
and they choose what job to take.[AN]
And if they don't pitch in, then[N]
adults get thrown out of the village.[N]
That, or locked up, sometimes.[A]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] What happens if they're bad[N]
at the job that they chose, Windy?[AN]
[R]
Then the chief has 'em switch to another.[AN]
If they're bad at everything[Beat] Well,[N]
I haven't heard of that happening,[N]
outside of folks who can't work at all.[AN]
The chief takes care of those people[N]
themself, Granny said. That cover it?[A]
[FL]
Just one more question, about the chief.[N]
What happens when a chief is bad[N]
at their job, or corrupt?[AN]
[R]
Uh[Beat] I don't know. Never seen it.[N]
I guess Quispe might be, since[N]
they let Gramps die, right?[AN]
[L]
Gramps? Who the hell's that?[A]
[R]
Oh, Wayra, I mean. But nobody's gonna[N]
believe that, so I guess Quispe'll[N]
stick around and keep being corrupt.[AN]
Anyway, there are nice things about[N]
the village. I never had to go hungry,[N]
even though I didn't have any family.[AN]
But[Beat] I wanted to make my own way,[N]
and I could never do that back home.[N]
So thanks for taking me on, captain![AN]
[FR]
[Beat]You're welcome, kid.[A]
[R]
Well, I'm gonna take off. Later![A][CSSCF]
[FL]
A rambunctious child, isn't she[Beat][N]
Still, that was enlightening.[AN]
This ideal that so many have fought[N]
and died for in Incendivis[Beat][N]
Windy's testimony is the reality.[AN]
[L]
Tch. A lot of those [OQ]rebels[CQ] are nothing[N]
but trash, fighting without a real cause.[N]
I'd know. Plenty of 'em in our old gang.[AN]
[FR]
Oh? And you weren't one of them?[A]
[L]
[Beat]Nah, I was. I couldn't think[N]
of any other way to fight back[N]
against the world I was born into.[AN]
To fight against the idea that[N]
I could have so much, while another[N]
kid, right outside the manor walls,[AN]
could have so little. But seeing[N]
the world with the Skysabers[Beat][N]
It's taught me a lot, captain.[AN]
When I'm back to fighting the good[N]
fight, I'll take all those lessons[N]
with me. And that's a promise.[A]
[FR]
[Beat]That's good to hear, Jaime.[N]
You've always had impressive passion.[N]
I respect that, about you. Always have.[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]For my part, I have no idea[N]
whether I'll return to that fight.[AN]
The life of a pirate, well[Beat][N]
I like it more than I imagined:[N]
at least, living it with you, captain.[AN]
No doubt, we've trials ahead of us[Beat][N]
But I've got no intention of running away.[N]
Not when I've got a gang of my own, again.[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] I never thought otherwise.[N]
Despite everything, Leonor[Beat][N]
You're as reliable as they come.[AN]
You both started as rebels, true[Beat][N]
But regardless, you're Skysabers now.[AN]
If you do leave, and you need help,[N]
I'll have the crew come running,[N]
no matter where you are. Got it?[A]
[L]
Clear as crystal, boss.[A]
[FL]
Same here. And likewise, captain.[A][X]

[FR][LoadLua][3LB]
Hello there, Estelle, Indio[Beat][N]
And Remora? An interesting group.[N]
What's got you three together?[AN]
[FL]
Ah, captain! I heard that Miss Remora[N]
here hunts treasure across the skies,[N]
so I thought to ask about her adventures.[AN]
[L]
Yeah, we figured she might know some way[N]
to sail closer to the stars, or at least,[N]
know of an island that's high in the sky.[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] Well, as far as I know,[N]
most floating islands rest[N]
around the same altitude.[AN]
[R]
The boss has it right. That said,[N]
there's a legend passed down by[N]
treasure hunters, like me.[AN]
Comes from some supposed ancient[N]
scrolls written by a man named[N]
Fisher. You know 'em, captain?[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] They sound familiar.[N]
Orlando may have told me about them,[N]
at some point. Always a conspiracist.[AN]
[R]
Bah, that guy[Beat] Anyway, these scrolls[N]
talk about what happened before the[N]
sky islands that we live on rose up.[AN]
The Fire Emblem connection, we know.[N]
Which, by the way? Crazy find, boss.[N]
Great timing for me to join, heh![AN]
But besides that, these scrolls[N]
reveal an important detail.[N]
Not all the islands rose equally.[AN]
[FL]
So[Beat] some ascended further[N]
than the ones that we live on?[AN]
[R]
That's the idea. And of those,[N]
there's one that supposedly[N]
rose more than any other[Beat][AN]
That island's called Albion.[AN]
[L]
Ooo, it's even got the sound[N]
of some old, mythical land[Beat][N]
How would you find it, Remora?[AN]
[R]
Come on. If I knew that, do you[N]
think I'd be here with you guys?[AN]
That said, I did get a little[N]
look-see at some ancient texts[N]
in that temple back in the village[Beat][AN]
And I might've nicked a couple,[N]
and looked them over myself.[AN]
Turns out, some of them speak[N]
about Albion, too[Beat] I think.[AN]
[FL]
That sounds less certain than[N]
I would like, but even so,[N]
it means that there's a chance.[AN]
We really may be able to see[N]
the stars more closely than[N]
on any of these other islands[Beat][AN]
How exciting! Remora, do you[N]
mind allowing Indio and I[N]
to look over these texts?[AN]
[L]
M-Me? But I didn't even say[N]
that I was[Beat] Ah, forget it.[N]
Yeah, I'm definitely in![AN]
[R]
Hm[Beat] Much as I'd like to keep[N]
all the info, maybe having some[N]
mages on board could help out-[AN]
[FR]
Remora.[AN]
[R]
Uh, yes, boss?[AN]
[FR]
Seems that you've forgotten[N]
to inform your captain[N]
about this finding, hm?[AN]
[R]
O-Oh, I, uh, didn't mean-[AN]
[FR]
Heh, relax. Sure, I'm interested[N]
in this Albion as much as any of you,[N]
but I've got enough on my plate already.[AN]
If you want to keep this venture[N]
to yourselves, be my guest.[N]
Just let me know if you need any help.[AN]
[R]
O-Of course, boss! Will do!
[FR]
As for you two[Beat] Estelle.[N]
I'm glad that you've found a way[N]
to make your dream true, really.[AN]
Just keep your head screwed on,[N]
and don't cut any corners.[N]
Do that, and you'll see it through.[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Thank you, Captain Lua.[N]
If I hadn't joined the Skysabers,[N]
I may never have learned of this[Beat][AN]
I owe this wind of fortune to you.[N]
And I will not let it go to waste![AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Good. And you, Indio.[N]
You didn't strike me as the kind[N]
of person who'd stick around, long.[AN]
But somehow, you have, all this time.[N]
So[Beat] no need for guilt, when you[N]
finally decide to make your own way.[AN]
[L]
Oh, come now, captain![AN]
As if I would ever let something[N]
like that curb my wanderlust[Beat][N]
Ha, really, I'd never[Beat] Ah, hell.[AN]
I'll admit it. I'll miss you guys![N]
Just[Beat] I only ask one thing.[N]
Take care of yourself, Captain Lua.[A]
[FR]
The same to you. And Remora[Beat][N]
Don't over-promise and under-deliver[N]
this Albion to these kids, got it?[AN]
Otherwise, you'll pay for it.[A]
[R]
Come on, who do you take me for?[N]
I'm a professional, boss.[N]
I never leave things half-done![AN]
So long as the islands don't[N]
fall first, we'll figure[N]
out where Albion is. Trust me![A]
[FR]
[Beat]Right. Anyway, I'll leave[N]
you three to your planning.[AN]

Mm. See you around, captain![A][CSSCF]

Take it easy![A][CSSCF]

Oh Albion, sweet Albion[Beat][A][CSSCF]

Hey there, captain![N]
Mighty fine day, isn't it?[AN]
[FR]
Seems the same as any other to me.[N]
What's got you so chipper, Biko?[A]
[L]
Ah, well, remember what Mr. Ernest
said back in the Keepers' village?
About sending that letter to his family?
Turns out, he got a response today![A]
[R]
Indeed. It took a bit longer than[N]
I expected, but with all the chaos,[N]
my package even reaching them[Beat][AN]
Well, that's a minor miracle.[AN]
Anyway, my siblings loved the gifts.[N]
Thanks, Ondeh. Your[Beat] tweaks to Biko's[N]
recommendations were a life saver.[A]
[FL]
Ha! When Biko came to me with his ideas,[N]
well[Beat] I knew that I couldn't let you[N]
give your siblings nothing but jams.[AN]
[L]
Bah[Beat] Fine, fine. I get it, okay?[N]
I like sweets more than most people.[N]
You don't have to rub it in, Ondeh.[AN]
[FL]
Oh, but I do. You've come so far since[N]
we first signed on with the captain.[N]
What else do I have to fuss over?[AN]
[L]
O-Oh? You really think so?[A]
[R]
For the record, I do, too.[N]
Your focus in battle has come leaps[N]
and bounds since we began sparring.[AN]
[L]
Y-Yeah, maybe you're right![AN]
These days, I feel like I can[N]
take on anyone, at any time.[N]
[Beat]What do you think, captain?[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] Well, you've still got your[N]
rough edges. No doubt about that.[N]
But still, you've gotten strong, Biko.[AN]
A far cry from that greenhorned kid[N]
that I picked up in Port Greagor.[N]
And the same goes for you, Ondeh.[AN]
[FL]
Thank you, captain. Really.[AN]
[Beat]I'll admit that, at the start,[N]
I wasn't sure that I wanted to play[N]
pirate. It felt like an obligation.[AN]
But, deep down, I always wanted an[N]
escape from the life that Biko[N]
and I were forced into, growing up.[AN]
And as a Skysaber, I've found that[N]
escape. I've found that freedom.[N]
And now[Beat] I've found a purpose.[AN]
I know that a lot is going on now,[N]
and a lot of it's going over my head[Beat][N]
But no matter what, I'm with you.[A]
[L]
T-The same goes for me, captain![N]
I've never been so good at anything,[N]
before! So[Beat] don't leave me behind![AN]
I wanna fight for the Skysabers[N]
and fly across the skies, forever![AN]
[R]
There's no telling how long we'll[N]
have to do that, with the falling[N]
and all[Beat] But I agree, captain.[AN]
There are few pirate crews as moral[N]
as this one[Beat] To the point that[N]
I doubted your intentions, at the start.[AN]
But you've proven to be every bit the[N]
woman that my former captain was:[N]
a woman worth following, to the end.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Talking like that's just going[N]
to jinx us, so can it, alright?[AN]
Stay sharp. Stay ready. Do that,[N]
and we'll be sailing these skies[N]
for a while yet. I promise you that.[AN][CSSCF]
[FL]
Off the captain goes[Beat][N]
Well, we'll do exactly that.[N]
Right, Biko? You'll stay sharp?[AN]
[L]
C'mon, Ondeh. Of course I will![N]
[Beat]Oh, right! I almost forgot.[N]
Here you go, Mr. Ernest. A gift![AN]
[R]
[Beat]Is this one of your jams?[AN]
[L]
Yeah! It's thanks for teaching[N]
me so well, and all that stuff.[AN]
[R]
Oh? Well, that's kind of you.[N]
[L]
Do you[Beat] not like jam?[AN]
[R]
W-What? No, no! Thank you so much.[N]
I'll, er[Beat] cherish this jam, forever![A][X]

Well, if it isn't the boss.[N]
What's got you in your quarters?[N]
Besides, y'know, it bein' yours.[AN]
[FR]
Uh, do I need any other reason?[N]
Actually, I should ask you the same.[N]
Why are you three all here, exactly?[AN]
[L]
Why else? To discuss business.[N]
With the Fire Emblem in our grasp,[N]
soon, too, will be plenty of trouble.[AN]
[R]
Mm. Truthfully, it's hard to imagine.[N]
Such a powerful relic, in our captain's[N]
sole possession[Beat] It's like a dream.[AN]
[FR]
Or a nightmare. If I'd have known that[N]
the thing would bond to me, and me only,[N]
I would've found another way to grab it.[AN]
[R]
And risk someone else having that power?[N]
I can think of no one else in this crew[N]
that I'd trust with it, not even myself.[AN]
No, I think that all of this happened[N]
as the Maker willed it, captain.[N]
So long as you use it responsibly.[AN]
[FL]
Use it to do what, exactly?[AN]
Far as we can tell, the whole world's[N]
goin' to shit. The sky ain't fallin';[N]
we are. Thanks to this thing, right?[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Perhaps. I never thought much[N]
about the old artifacts of the Keepers.[N]
Wayra knew more, I'm sure, but[Beat][AN]
[FL]
So maybe there's a way out without[N]
takin' that thing back. Maybe not.[N]
The question is, should we?[AN]
[R]
Well[Beat] I'm sure that a lot of people[N]
have noticed and are afraid, right now.[AN]
Mass chaos could spread, if we hold[N]
onto the Fire Emblem[Beat] I know that[N]
the whole point was to secure it,[AN]
but returning it could make sense.[N]
Though, if it's bonded to Captain Lua,[N]
is there even a method to do that?[AN]
[L]
Mm[Beat] Wayra spoke of rituals often.[N]
I would bet my life that one exists[N]
to separate the Fire Emblem and Lua.[AN]
We'd need a competent magic user,[N]
but we have that with you, Razvan.[AN]
The problem lies with Quispe, though.[N]
They intended to take the Fire Emblem[N]
for themself, after killing us. Remember?[AN]
So they'd just take it back from[N]
the dais, once we returned it.[N]
Or someone else would, later.[AN]
Maybe the islands falling[Beat][N]
It was all fated, to begin with.[N]
And maybe it'll be for the better.[AN]
[FL]
Hmph[Beat] Gotta say, I doubt that.[AN]
Not that the empire's all that,[N]
but none of us know the first[N]
damn thing about the Lands Below.[AN]
We go down there, and the only[N]
people who know what they're doin'[Beat][N]
That'll be the Keepers. Right?[AN]
They've gotta be the only ones[N]
with records goin' back that far.[AN]
[FR]
Unless the empire's hiding some,[N]
then yeah, that's a fair bet.[AN]
[Beat]I'll just tell you all that[N]
I've got no idea what I'll do[N]
with the Fire Emblem, just yet.[AN]
But right now? Let's savor it.[N]
We accomplished our goal, right?[N]
That deserves another feast, at least.[A]
[FL]
Damn right! That'll take the edge[N]
off the rest of the crew, too.[N]
How about we set that up, guys?[AN]
The boss's got enough on her plate.[A]
[L]
[Beat]Oh, that pun wasn't bad.[N]
For your standards, at least.[AN]
[R]
Hahaha[Beat] You really have gotten[N]
better, Desiderio. We've all grown,[N]
in some ways[Beat] Thanks to you, captain.[AN]
No matter what happens going forward[Beat][N]
Just know, I'll cherish these memories.[N]

I-I wasn't whispering, captain![N]
We were[Beat] er[Beat] just talking[N]
about ordinary stuff. Yep![AN]
[FL]
Valerie[Beat] Just quit while you're ahead.[AN]
[R]
Right. You've got plenty of strengths,[N]
kiddo, but lying isn't one of them.[AN]
[FR]
Mm. That's more your area, isn't it?[AN]
[R]
You wound me, captain! But it's true.[N]
Still though, our discussion really[N]
isn't anything to concern yourself over.[AN]
[FR]
I'll be the judge of that. Spill.[AN]
[R]
Ah[Beat] Well, if you say so, then sure.[N]
Calista and I were just catching up.[AN]
We served in the same deployments,[N]
once or twice. She left quite the[N]
impression on me, I must say.[AN]

Likewise, though for the wrong reasons.[N]
Anyway, our discussion was personal,[N]
so I figured it was no one's business.[AN]

And I'm your captain,[N]

[Beat]Fair enough. I was just curious[N]
about what led him to leave TORCH..[N]
You've already got an idea, right?[AN]

Sure. He spilled his guts already.[AN]

Then no point in repeating it.[N]
Wasn't too different from why[N]

Incendivis lost its way. The vibrant[N]
empire in our history books, where[N]

It doesn't exist anywhere, anymore.[N]
Nowhere except in those books.[AN]

Hey, you said you cleared[N]
it with the boss, Orlando.[AN]
I'm not gettin' on her bad side,[N]

Same here. Ain't worth the trouble.[AN]

[Beat]Oh, fine. It isn't an errand,[N]

An opportunity for what?[AN]
[R]
[Beat]For enrichment of my coinpurse.[AN]
You see, I still have excess wares,[N]
and what with the islands falling,[N]
I came upon a simple, brilliant idea.[AN]
[FR]
Let me guess. You're going to take[N]
advantage of the chaos and panic[N]
to sell goods at marked up prices?[AN]
[R]
Ah, you say it with such judgement![AN]
Am I not a merchant, Lua?[N]
Am I not in the business providing[N]
my customers with what they desire?[AN]
If it so happens that many desire[N]
the same goods, well[Beat] I cannot[N]
simply ignore the increased demand.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Somehow, I've lost even more respect[N]
for you. Didn't think that was possible.[A]
[FL]
Ha! That's harsh, boss. But I get it.[N]
Anyway, he hired us on as security.[AN]
We guard the overpriced crap he sells,[N]
and we guard him in case any customers[N]
get pissed at him rippin' them off.[AN]
[FR]
That [OQ]in case[CQ] seems pretty likely.[N]
Well, whatever. Do as you like.[AN]
[R]
A-Ah, good. I almost thought that[N]
you may try to veto my plan.[N]
All that work, to ashes[Beat][AN]
[FR]
Morally, I probably should.[N]
But outside of your jobs on the ship,[N]
you're all free to do as you please.[AN]
So long as no one in the crew gets[N]
screwed, run whatever scams you want.[AN]
[Beat]But let me say this. There are[N]
people out there who are scared.[N]

you, Adrian, and Lexa can handle[Beat][N]

Hmph[Beat] Yeah, gotta agree with my sis.[AN]
Sure, we're pirates. Killers, sometimes.[N]
But the captain's always tried to have[N]
us do more. To be better than that.[AN]
Doesn't she expect the same outta you?[A]
[R]
[Beat]Who knows? I can scarcely tell what[N]
she thinks, except that I'm less than[N]

[FL]
Nah, I don't think so.[N]
If she thought that of ya,[N]
why would she be so angry?[N]
Me and Lexa, we get mad at each other.[N]
But it ain't like we don't care, y'know?[N]
It's because we care that we get mad.[AN]

Captain? W-What brings you to our table?[A]
[FR]
Sounded like a game of cards was on,[N]
and I'm always in. Good for a fourth?[AN]
[L]
Oh, hrm, I don't know about-[A]
[FR]
Wouldn't want me to mention that you[N]
palmed a card on the second draw?[AN]
[FL]
You son of a[Beat] I knew it![N]
I knew something was fishy![A]
[L]
You were watching us, captain?[N]
[Beat]Fine, I admit it. Here![N]
Take back my hard-earned winnings![AN]
[R]
Hard-earned, my ass.[A]
[FR]
[Beat]You know, while I was watching,[N]
I saw some other interesting things.[AN]
The right-most card in your hand,[N]
Tang[Beat] It's got a little fold on it.[AN]
[L]
Hm? But this was a fresh deck.[N]
That[Beat] Tangyuan, you scamp![AN]
[R]
[Beat]Heh. Well, since it's you, captain,[N]
I don't mind fessing up. Yep, I did it.[N]
That's how I knew that Juan cheated.[AN]
Cheats only lose to other cheats, y'know?[A]
[FL]
Man[Beat] You both are real pieces of work.[N]
Why'd I even bother to play with you?[N]
C'mon, captain. Let's go, one-on-one-[AN]
[FR]
You'd like that, wouldn't you?[AN]
After all, you've been taking every[N]
distraction as an excuse to snatch[N]
a few doubloons, on the sly. Right?[AN]
[FL]
W-What? Haha, no way! I'd never![A]
[L]
Hm, hold on. The pot is a few coins[N]
short, actually. I counted, earlier.[N]
My, Leandra[Beat] Not even artful, are you?[AN]
[R]
So what, we're all cheaters?[N]
Ha[Beat] haha! That's hilarious.[AN]
[FR]
Look, I mostly did this for fun.[AN]
But let me give you a warning:[N]
stop screwing around like this.[N]
We've got enough going on around us.[AN]
We don't need any fights breaking[N]
out over a game of cards. Got it?[AN]
[L]
Oh, come now, captain![AN]
In times like this, we need[N]
a bit of fun more than ever![N]
And cheating's always fun![AN]
[FL]
Besides, it ain't that big a deal.[N]
Trust me, boss. Somethin' like this[N]
isn't gonna get us riled up at all.[AN]
[R]
Yeah. You know how many fights we've[N]
been in at this point? Some tricks[N]
among friends, well[Beat] That's nothing.[AN]
Hell, it might even make the games[N]
more fun, now that we know we're[N]
all cheating. Makes things fair.[AN]
[FR]
Fair? When you're all[Beat] cheating?[N]
Well, whatever. If you can keep your[N]
cool about it, then do what you want.[AN]
You three have been around since[N]
Port Greagor now[Beat] Old hands, all.[N]
You've earned a bit of grace.[A][CSSCF]
[L]
That may be the nicest thing[N]
that she's ever said about me.[AN]
[FL]
It's definitely the nicest thing[N]
that she's ever said about me.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]I hope it's not the nicest thing[N]
that she ever says about me.[A]
[L]
What?[A]
[R]
Nothing. So, game's back on?[AN]
[FL]
Hell yeah! Better keep your eyes open,[N]

If you have to ask, then yes.[N]
We were enjoying the silence[N]
until you showed up, kid.[A]
[L]
Mm. Enjoying it quite a bit.[N]
Since I joined this crew,[N]
I've felt no peace like it.[AN]
[FR]
Well, sorry, I guess. Not many[N]
places to get peace on a pirate[N]
ship. You knew that coming in.[AN]
[L]
I did, and I don't regret joining.[N]
But a bit of quiet now and then,[N]
among friends, is a welcome reprieve.[AN]
[FL]
Agreed, though I would go a step[N]
further. It is a necessary reprieve.[AN]
Imagine if we had no choice but to[N]
stand next to Desiderio, day in,[N]
day out, and listen to his battle yell.[AN]

We all do. Call it a little game[N]

[FR]
[Beat]Should I ask where I am on the list?[A]

I mean, you walk around with a musket.[N]
Who'd want to stand next to that[N]
and have their ears ring for an hour?[A]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] Guess I can't dispute that.[AN]

If it makes you feel better, captain,[N]
we all still respect you greatly.[AN]
For years, I merely wandered the sands,[N]

Mm. I concur with Dmitr. Not many[N]

But I would miss this crew, more.[A]

[Beat]Bah. Don't expect me to get sappy.[N]
But fine, I'll say it, kid.[N]
You're an alright captain.[A]

Hmph. You [OQ]get[CQ] nothing, child.[N]
You have merely started upon the[N]
long road of cultivating your inner-[AN]
[L]
Kaisa, don't listen to a[N]
thing that this guy says.[AN]
[FR][LoadLua]
Some kind of argument, here?[N]
Don't go picking on the trainee,[N]
Ruby. She's new to this pirating thing.[AN]
[L]
I'm not picking on squat, captain.[N]
I'm trying to get her not to listen[N]
to this fraud. It's for her own good.[AN]
[FL]
Tch. A fraud? Bold words for an[N]
inferior student of the blade.[AN]
[R]
That's not nice, Aristides.[N]
Ruby tries her best, y'know?[AN]
[FL]
Effort yields only so much, my student.
A man who swings his blade a thousand
times learns that swing well, true.
But if the swing cuts shallow,
then what fruit has he gained
from this? Naught but rotten pears.
[R]
Woah[Beat] That's deep!
[L]
As deep as a puddle after the rain.[N]
I've been in my fair share of tussles.[N]
Real fights. So let me say this:[AN]
It's real rich hearing this from[N]
a man who'd never left home until[Beat][N]
what? A week ago? Two, maybe?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]What I lack in worldly knowledge,[N]
I make up for in knowledge of myself.[AN]
I have had decades to hone my blade[N]
to perfection[Beat] To master my craft.[N]
In true combat, with true warriors.[AN]
[L]
Is that what you call the other nutjobs[N]
who were living with you in that commune?[AN]
[FL]
Still your tongue, knave! Each of them[N]
possesses more mastery in their pinky[N]
then you do in your entire body![AN]
[L]
That so? Let's test that![A]
[FL]
[Beat]If it is a fight you wish for, then-[A]
[FR]
Alright, alright! Enough![N]
Can't you see that Kaisa here's[N]
shaking? You're scaring the poor girl.[AN]
[R]
Scaring? Oh, no, captain.[N]
I just thought it'd be awesome[N]
to see them fight, is all.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Awesome?[AN]
[R]
Yeah! It'd be like, ka-blam![N]
And wa-pow! And ker-whammy![AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Well, I didn't expect that.[N]
I guess you did seem a bit bold[N]
when we met, but[Beat] not like this.[AN]
[R]
Heh, trust me, captain. The only thing[N]
I like better than watchin' a fight[N]
is gettin' into the ring myself![AN]
[Beat]So, uh, when's the duel starting?[N]
You guys are keeping me in suspense.[A]
[L]
Uh[Beat] Well, what do you think,[N]
Aristides? Got time for one now?[AN]
[FL]
Well, I suppose I've nothing else to do.[N]
But duels require rules, and guidelines.[AN]
Whatever lowly brawl you had in mind,[N]
cast it aside. Fighting is an art form,[N]
and our swordplay must adhere to that.[AN]
[L]
I really don't think anybody cares about[N]
that but you, but[Beat] Fine, I guess.[N]
That is, if the captain's the ref.[AN]
[FR]
Uh[Beat] You want me to watch the fight?[AN]
[L]
Watch it, and call who's winning.[N]
Give points. That kind of stuff.[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] That sounds like a pain.[N]
Do I really have to do this?[AN]

Airhead? That's kinda harsh, Ruby.[N]
I'm a pretty skilled fighter, y'know?[AN]
Not to brag, but I might be better[N]
with a spear than you are with[N]
any of your weapons[Beat] combined.[AN]
[R]
That's not nice, Florencia.[N]
Ruby tries her best, y'know?[AN]
[FL]
Of course, I'm not knocking her effort.[N]
It took me a long while to get where[N]
I am, so I remember the path well.[AN]
Not everybody walks the road to master[N]
their weapon at the same rate as I did[Beat][AN]
But one way or another, we can all[N]
reach that path's end. Got it, Kaisa?[AN]
[R]
Yeah[Beat] That's deep![AN]
[L]
As deep as a puddle after the rain.[N]
I've been in my fair share of tussles.[N]

It's real rich hearing this from[N]

C'mon, now. I left a couple times[Beat][N]
uh, at some point. Not sure when.[AN]
Besides, what's it matter if I left[N]

[MR][LoadLua]
[Beat]Again with you two? Look,[N]
if this is going to be a problem,[N]
then one of you needs to leave.[AN]
[L]
Hey, there's no problem here.[AN]
I was just making sure that[N]
she's the person that I thought[N]
she was. Ain't that right, Theana?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Tch. Just get on with it.[N]
You're going to tell the[N]
captain all about me, right?[A]
[L]
Sure, if she wants to hear about you.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Look, I'm not in the business[N]
of prying into people's pasts.[AN]
If Theana won't tell me herself,[N]
then I don't want to hear it.[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]And if I don't tell you?[AN]
[MR]
Then I won't ever fully trust you,[N]
no matter how much I wish I could.[AN]
You do your job well, Theana,[N]
but there's too much mystery[N]
around you to look away from.[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Hmph. Fine. I can tell you,[N]
captain. But only you and Kai,[N]
so the buzzard gets off my back.[AN]
He's already mentioned that we shared[N]
the same master. A man named Absalom.[N]
An ex-Keeper, if you'd believe it.[AN]
[MR]
Ex? What made him leave the flock?[A]
[L]
Disagreements with the former head,[N]
Wayra. Master Absalom always had[N]
an independent streak, you feel me?[AN]
A lone wolf kinda guy. Lived on his[N]
own island, gathered his own food[Beat][AN]
[MR]
What gets a man like that to take[N]
in trainees? Doesn't seem the type.[A]
[FL]
[Beat]We were orphans. All of us.[N]
He took us in because we had no place[N]
else to go[Beat] The Keepers abandoned us.[AN]
[MR]
Abandoned? They threw little kids out?[AN]
[FL]
They threw out children of "heretics",[N]
people who opposed the village's rules,[N]
if those heretics happened to die.[AN]
Dropped us off on Absalom's doorstep.[A]
[L]
Mm. A brighter side of me thinks they[N]
might've tried to keep us around,[N]
if our master wouldn't take us in.[AN]
[Beat]But who knows? Without him,[N]
maybe they'd have just dumped[N]
us to the Lands Below, huh?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Maybe so. Regardless, he raised us[N]
like a father, but a stern one.[AN]
He taught us everything he knew[N]
about combat, again and again[Beat][N]
And I was his best student, once.[AN]
[L]
[OQ]An artist of the afterworld[CQ][Beat][AN]
Pretty high praise! I never saw Theana[N]
for myself til she joined the crew,[N]
but the old man wasn't lying.[AN]
So, let's get to the main point.[N]
Why'd you go your own way, Theana?[A]
[FL]
[Beat]Absalom saw battle as a holy thing.[N]
Something meant to be respected.[AN]
But for me[Beat] I wanted to use my skills[N]
to get back at the people who wronged me.[N]
Who wronged my family[Beat] The Keepers.[AN]
We argued and argued over it, but[N]
in the end, he told me that he wanted[N]
no part in whatever I had planned.[AN]
And that[Beat] that meant I had to leave.[AN]
[MR]
Wait, so[Beat] when you were in that[N]
village, does that mean you were-[AN]
[FL]
Looking for targets? Pretty much.[N]
Over the past ten years, I'd drifted[N]
in and out of the village to do that.[AN]
Pick off a little lamb here, there,[N]
and eventually[Beat] the flock's culled.[AN]
Of course, I still needed to survive,[N]
so taking a job with a pirate crew[N]
that I'd leave in a few months[Beat][AN]
That was a good way to skip town.[N]
Only, I didn't suspect that you'd[N]
pull me into the spotlight, captain.[AN]
[L]
Heh! Yeah, I guess stealing the[N]
Fire Emblem'll make it harder[N]
for you to sneak around, won't it?[AN]
[FL]
Hmph[Beat] Yes, I doubt that I'll get[N]
any chances to pick off Keeper leaders.[AN]
So for now, I'll keep on with your[N]
crew, captain. I'll fight your battles.[N]
And then, I'll disappear without a trace.[AN]
[L]
You'll at least tell me where you're[N]
headed, yeah? We're pretty much family.[AN]
[FL]
And risk you pestering me more? No.[N]
[Beat]Is that enough about me, captain?[AN]
[MR]
Sure. Thanks for telling me, Theana.[N]
I know it couldn't have been easy.[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]No, it wasn't. I'll be going.[A]
[MR]
Well, what about you, Kai?[N]
What are your plans, going forward?[A]
[L]
Me? I don't know. Haven't thought[N]
about it, but I like it here, y'know?[AN]
You and Master Pilar gave me a chance[N]
to prove myself. To show that old man[N]
that I'm more than just a failure[Beat][AN]
So I'll probably stick around,[N]
so long as you'll have me, boss.[AN]
[MR]
Glad to hear it. You've come a long way[N]
from that flippant weakling that you[N]
used to be. You're a reliable guy, Kai.[AN][CSSCF]
[L]
Heh[Beat] Always gotta couch the praise[N]
with an insult, huh? Fine by me.[AN]
From the boss, that's damn near[N]
a standing ovation, hahaha![AN]
[Beat]Master Absalom, I've found[N]
my place, just like you said.[N]
And I'm never gonna give it up![AN][X]
