[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[MR]
Boss. Still picking[N]
where to fly, right?[A]
[ML]
With the Fire Emblem, the[N]
whole sky's our oyster.[AN]
[Beat]Something's on your mind, Desi.[N]
I know you well enough to see it.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[CloseEyes]Francisca was the same[N]
way, back then. Both of[N]
you see right through me[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll just cut to the chase.[N]
I've found Rogelio.[A]
[ML][2LB]
The traitor from your old crew?[AN]
I know you've been on his[N]
trail for a while, but[Beat][AN]
how did you manage that?[A]
[MR][3LB]
He had a contact back[N]
in the Keepers' village.[AN]
Some cowardly little man[N]
[CloseEyes]named[Beat][OpenEyes] Boru, I recall.[AN]
While we were back in town,[N]
planning our raid on the[N]
Fire Emblem's shrine[Beat][AN]
[Smile]I finally got my[N]
answers out of him.[Smile][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]Right.[AN]
Where is he, then? If that's[N]
to be our next destination.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Rogelio and his men are holed up[N]
at some desolate little rock[N]
on the edge of the skies.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Not too different from[N]
old Snowthorne, really.[AN][OpenEyes]
Folk call it the Icy Crown.[N]
Some ruin lifted up from[N]
the Lands Below long ago.[AN]
All that matters to me,[N]
though, is who's inside.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Sounds like quite the place.[AN]
I'd guess Rogelio has already[N]
cleared out any plunder that-[A]
[MR]
This isn't about treasure any more.[AN]
We have the Fire Emblem. That's[N]
all we could ever want for loot.[AN]
No, this is about revenge.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I want that bastard dead for[N]
what he did to the Roseblades.[AN]
His face's haunted my nightmares[N]
since before I joined the Skysabers.[AN]
[OpenEyes]We have to go to the Icy Crown, Lua.[AN]
We have to make sure the Roseblades[N]
finally get to rest in peace.[A][X]

## HubD1Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
[Smile]It's been good having you[N]
as a quartermaster, Desi.[AN]
You've saved us all from[N]
disaster time and time again.[AN]
It's the least I can do to[N]
help you set things right.[A][Smile]
[MR]
Glad to hear.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Thanks, boss.[AN]
[Smile]I'm glad to be part[N]
of a crew like yours.[OpenEyes][A][Smile]
[ML]
[Smile]It's the least I can do.[AN][Smile]
I'll bring Pilar up[N]
to speed on the route,[AN]
and we'll set off for the[N]
Icy Crown as soon as we can.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[CloseEyes]Francisca[Beat][AN]
I'll bring you justice.[N]
Once and for all.[A][X]

[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]What the hell, Lua?[A]
[ML][2LB]
Calm down, Desi.[AN]
I understand that this is[N]
important to you, but-[A]
[MR][MoveRight]
[R][3LB]
I've followed you through[N]
thick and thin, boss.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've gone on every job you[N]
thought was worth your time.[AN]
I even held my tongue when we[N]
worked for the damn Rebels![AN]
[OpenEyes]But what was the point,[AN]
if all that's out the[N]
window the instant I'm[N]
the one needing your help?[A]
[ML]
Damn it, Desi, you know[N]
that's not what I meant![AN]
Of course I'm fine with[N]
helping my second in command.[AN]
That's what being[N]
part of a crew is for.[AN]
It's just[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm not ready to commit[N]
to a job like this.[AN]
Not with the state the[N]
sky is in right now.[AN][OpenEyes]
We'll go after Rogelio soon.[N]
I swear it as your captain.[A]
[R][1LB]
[Beat]Right.[A] [OpenQuote]Soon."[AN]
Let's hope so, Captain Lua.[A][X]

[MR][LoadRazvan][3LB]
C-Captain! Are you still[N]
deciding on our destination?[N]
If so, I have a favor to ask.[AN]
[ML]
Hm[Beat] A favor? Rare for you[N]
to call one in, Razvan.[N]
Let me hear it before I decide.[AN]
[MR]
Right, of course. It's just that[N]
we're fairly close to my old village[Beat][N]
I want to go check on everyone, please.[AN]
[ML]
What's with the change of heart?[N]
Last time we sailed through here,[N]
you wanted to stay well away.[AN]
[MR]
That was before all the islands[N]
began falling out of the sky![AN]
But now, pandemonium's broken out,[N]
and the lowest of the low mean[N]
to take advantage of the chaos.[AN]
You've already seen that, right?[A]
[ML]
Yeah, I've seen it, alright.[AN]
Pirates and bandits plying their[N]
trade with almost no resistance[Beat][N]
Worried that they'll attack your home?[AN]
[MR]
Of course I am! In the Taklakama Desert,[N]
there's another group of famed raiders[N]
who gave us no small amount of grief.[AN]
They call themselves the Redwings[Beat][N]
They're a gang of scum that fly in[N]
and take anything they can from us.[AN]
I'm certain that they'll take this[N]
chance to do something that I[Beat][N]
That I can't allow them to do![AN]
[ML]
I understand your fears, Razvan.[N]
That said, I see several imperial[N]
ships sitting there in the port.[AN]
Don't you think that they can[N]
handle the situation themselves?[AN]
[MR]
I'm not sure. With that few of them,[N]
there can't be many soldiers here,[N]
and the Redwings are high in number.[AN]
I know this is a selfish request,[N]
but please[Beat] I'm worried about[N]
my mother and everyone else.[AN]
I won't be at ease unless I make[N]
sure the Redwings aren't a threat,[N]
personally. Please, captain![A][X]

## HubD3Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]When you say it like that,[N]
how can I say no, Razvan?[N]
We'll make port right away.[AN]
[MR]
R-Really? Thank you, captain![N]
I thought that you'd reject[N]
my request with ease[Beat][AN]
[ML]
Hm? What gave you that impression?[AN]
[MR]
I guess because[Beat] No matter how kind[N]
you may be, you're still a pirate.[N]
And pirates prioritize themselves.[AN]
Taking a risk on saving some villagers,[N]
people that you've never even met[Beat][N]
It just isn't your way, is it?[AN]
[ML]
Yeah, no doubt about that.[N]
But I have met you, haven't I?[AN]
Over this past year, you've put[N]
your life on the line to pay[N]
this "debt" you keep mentioning.[AN]
But like I said before, any debt[N]
there was is long since paid.[N]
But you've stuck around, right?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Of course. I couldn't return home,[N]
anyway. I'd only bring them trouble.[AN]
And despite not always liking our work,[N]
I do like being here, with everyone.[N]
[Beat]Do you think that I should leave?[AN]
[ML]
No. I'd never say that to you, Razvan.[AN]
It's just that, since you're still here,[N]
you're making me go into my own debt[N]
with each time you work your magic.[AN]
So[Beat] it's about time that I paid it.[N]
That's all this is. Understand?[AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] Understood. Then I won't[N]
waste my breath thanking you, captain.[N]
Let's go clip those bandits' wings![A][X]

## HubD3Selection_No
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][3LB]
Sorry, but I'm against it, for now.[N]
Putting aside the risk of us sailing[N]
into a port with imperial soldiers,[AN]
how do you intend to make sure that[N]
these Redwings [OQ]aren't a threat[CQ]?[N]
Wiping them out to the last man?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]If that's what it takes, then yes.[N]
We've taken lives from people who[N]
deserved it less than they do.[AN]
[ML]
It's not about the morality of it.[AN]
But if these Redwings are as fearsome[N]
as you say, I don't see a world where[N]
we eliminate them without casualties.[AN]
It's better that we let the imperials[N]
whittle the Redwings down for a while[N]
and come later to clean up the scraps.[AN]
[MR]
Later[Beat] What if later is too late?[N]
What if my mother dies to those raids[N]
while we sail around without thought?[A]
[ML]
Sorry, Razvan, but I have to worry[N]
about everyone here, not just you.[N]
This is my decision. For now.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Fine. I won't push you anymore.[N]
I just[Beat] You said that my debt to[N]
you was clear, captain. Didn't you?[AN]
[ML]
I did, yeah. What's your point?[AN]
[MR]
Then there's nothing keeping me here,[N]
anymore. If you decide to wait too[N]
long, I'll have no choice but to leave.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You've saved us countless times over,[N]
Razvan. Whatever it is that you want to do,[N]
I won't try to stop you from doing it.[AN]
But[Beat] I'll miss you if you leave, kid.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[Beat]And I would miss you too, captain.[N]
So please, don't make me wait long.[N]
Otherwise, I really will[Beat][A][X]
