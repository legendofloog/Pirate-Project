[MR][LoadRogelio]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]So this is what it's come to.[N]
All our dreams of becoming[N]
more than a pack of thieves[Beat][AN]
blown away like the icy[N]
wind of this damned ruin.[AN]
Even Quispe has abandoned us,[N]
now that the sky's begun to fall.[A]
[ML][2LB]
We've done all we could, Rogelio.[N]
Then and now. Always.[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]Have we?[AN]
We could've fought harder,[N]
maybe. We could've done more.[A]
[ML]
We've fought. Don't deny that.[AN]
[Smile]We've pried places like this[N]
away from the Empire's grasp[Beat][AN]
places where we're free from[N]
tyrant captains and lords.[AN]
We had good times out here,[N]
Rogelio. Don't forget that.[A][Smile]
[MR]
Good times? Maybe. But[N]
don't dare call this victory.[AN]
You remember Desiderio, don't[N]
you? From the old crew?[A]
[ML]
Francisca's one-eyed lackey?[N]
More than I'd like to.[AN]
What about him?[A]
[MR][3LB]
Have you heard the tales[N]
of the Skysaber pirate band?[AN]
The ones who slew Cruz[N]
and Azahar, and devastated[N]
all Quispe could bring to bear?[AN]
While we've languished here,[N]
Desiderio's taken charge and[N]
spearheaded their victories.[AN]
[CloseEyes]We thought to be the[N]
rising stars who could[N]
change the world, Solange.[AN]
But the only Roseblade who[N]
got that privilege was the[N]
most small-minded of all.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[MR][2LB]
[OpenEyes]What was the point, Solange?[AN]
[CloseEyes]Us, the rebellion, all of it[Beat][N]
What was the damn point?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes]You're talking about our[N]
efforts in the past, Rogelio.[AN]
[Smile]But we're still here, aren't we?[AN][Smile]
Us, and our followers[Beat] we[N]
still have cards left to play.[AN]
Quispe's not dead, the[N]
rumors say. Just vanished.[AN]
[Smile]And with the islands falling[Beat][N]
who knows what will happen next?[A][Smile]
[FFL][LoadDalila]
What'll happen next, you say?[N]
Well, I have an idea[Beat][A]
[MR][1LB]
[OpenEyes]Who goes there?[A][X]


## D1_Intro_RogSolDalilaEnters
[ML][LoadDalila]
[R][LoadSolange]
[FR][LoadRogelio]
[ML]
None other than the [Smile]first[N]
mate of the Blackhearts.[AN][Smile]
You'll get out of our way, if[N]
you know what's good for you.[A]
[R]
I've heard your name, pirate.[AN]
The Icy Crown is our home.[N]
It's not for you to plunder.[A]
[ML]
Things stopped being about[N]
loot a long time ago.[AN]
[CloseEyes]After TORCH, and the Skysabers[Beat][AN]
It's a different world, now.[AN][OpenEyes]
Though I suppose your crew[N]
always was stuck in the past.[AN]
Guess that's why [Smile]Alonso's on[N]
top while you're down here, hm?[Smile][A]
[FR][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[R][2LB]
Stand back, Rogelio.[AN]
If she's here to fight, my[N]
sword will drive her back.[A]
[ML]
You haven't been shot yet.[AN]
Take that as a sign I'm[N]
willing to talk, maybe.[AN]
Though [Smile]I'd be happy to take[N]
everything you've not nailed down.[A][Smile]
[FR][1LB]
[Beat][OpenEyes]What do you have to say, then?[A]
[ML][2LB]
You're ours, Rogelio.[N]
This ruin is ours.[A]
[R]
Never! I'd sooner die[N]
than abandon my-[A]
[FR][1LB]
Wait![A]
[R]
[Beat]Rogelio?[A]
[FR][2LB]
Take the Icy Crown, then.[N]
Do what you will with me.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm done trying to[N]
fight against my fate.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]Really now?[A]
[FR][2LB]
I brought doom to[N]
the Roseblades, once.[AN]
I'll not doom you to fight yet[N]
another hopeless battle, Solange.[A]
[R]
After all this time[Beat][AN]
You want us to go back to[N]
obeying common pirates?[AN]
Following Alonso, of all people?[N]
A man who sold out to TORCH?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]I can't blame him[N]
for the choices he made.[AN]
After all, look how[N]
ours turned out for us.[AN]
We're all traitors, here.[A]
[R][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
Maybe you should've been a poet[N]
in another life, not a rebel.[AN]
Lucky for you, Rogelio,[N]
Captain Alonso doesn't[N]
want you dead just yet.[AN]
You, on the horse. You're[N]
supposed to be his second[N]
in command, aren't you?[AN]
Ready whatever fighters you can[Beat][A][X]

## D1_Intro_Conditional
[ML][LoadErnest]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]
Ah, Leandra. I've been meaning[N]
to speak to you for a while.[AN]
Ever since I saw that you,[N]
too, had joined this crew[Beat][A]
[MR]
Oh, huh. [Smile]Good to see you, Ernest![AN][Smile]
A bit surprised you didn't go[N]
down with the ship, to be honest.[A]
[ML][3LB]
For a while, maybe.[AN]
But I'm here, now.[N]
As is Desiderio.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]We've really started[N]
putting the old crew back[N]
together, haven't we?[A]
[MR][2LB]
Hey, don't try and[N]
get all sappy with me.[AN]
[Smile]I'm just going where the[N]
money's good, is all.[A][Smile]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]You've never been a good[N]
liar, Leandra. Don't try.[A]
[MR]
Fair, fair.[AN]
[Smile]Guess it's nice fighting[N]
alongside old friends, too.[AN]
Though I certainly won't complain[N]
about the loot we can dig up.[AN][Smile]
[ML]
Old friends[Beat] [CloseEyes]Aside[N]
from Rogelio, you mean.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Captain Lua did tell you why[N]
we're on this job, right?[AN]
[MR]
Who cares about that guy anyway?[AN]
[CloseEyes]So he sold us out. So what?[N]
That's how life goes sometimes.[AN]
We all have to skip out on[N]
one employer or another.[A][OpenEyes]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Is that how[N]
you see things, then?[A]
[MR]
Ah, hell. Let's put this on[N]
pause. Desi's coming this way.[AN]
I probably shouldn't say stuff[N]
like that in front of him.[AN]
Let's duck below decks[Beat][A][X]

## D1_Intro_OnBoat
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
Judging from the weather, we're[N]
getting close to the Icy Crown.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Probably should've brought a[N]
coat with proper sleeves[Beat][A][OpenEyes]
[MR]
Looks like it.[A][N]
My vision's seen better days,[A][N]
but even I can spot those[N]
towers through the clouds.[A][N]
[Beat][CloseEyes]We're almost there, huh?[A]
[ML][1LB]
Pilar wouldn't lead us astray.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[OpenEyes]Can't say that's what I meant.[A][N]
[CloseEyes][Smile]I've spent seven years dreaming[N]
of getting my hands on Rogelio[Beat][N]
and now that'll be today.[A][N]
Finally putting what's left[N]
of the Roseblades to rest.[Smile][A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]What's it like?[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]What do you mean?[A]
[ML][2LB]
[OpenEyes]Wanting revenge as badly as this.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I've been crossed by a[N]
lot of people, in my day.[A][N]
But I can't say I've ever[N]
hated any of them like this.[A]
[MR][3LB]
That's because none of 'em sold[N]
out your crew. Your friends.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Someone you spent years fighting[N]
alongside, trusting your life to,[N]
stabbing you in the back.[A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]I guess not.[A][N]
The way things are going,[N]
everyone who wants me dead[N]
at least says it to my face.[A][N]
[Beat][LoadOverworldFaces]On that note. Look there.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[OpenEyes]There's a ship docked[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]with a Blackheart flag![A][N]
What in the Maker's name[N]
could they be doing here?[A]
[MR]
Alonso was a Roseblade, once.[A][N]
Though Francisca kicked him out[N]
long before things went to hell.[AN]
Maybe he's got some bone[N]
to pick with Rogelio too.[A]
[ML]
Or their problem's with us.[A][N]
Blackhearts showing up here[N]
at the same time as we did[Beat][A]
[MR]
Can't say it matters.[A][N]
Blackheart or no, they'll not[N]
stand between me and Rogelio![A][N]
[Smile]Let's bring those[N]
bastards down, Captain![A][X]


## D1_DalilaBrags
[MR][LoadDalila]
Ah, there come the Skysabers.[N]
Took them long enough.[AN]
Seems the famed Rogelio was[N]
the perfect bait for this trap.[AN]
Now then, rebels[Beat][AN]
Soften them up, why don't[N]
you? I'll go for the kill.[A][X]

## D1_DesiRogTalk
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadRogelio]
[ML]
ROGELIO! You backstabbing bastard![AN]
Today's the day you die[N]
for what you've done![A]
[MR][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
Any last words before I crush[N]
you like the rat you are?[A]
[MR]
[Beat][OpenEyes]Why should I bother?[AN]
Nothing I say can change anything,[N]
now. I died a long time ago.[AN]
If [CloseEyes]Solange's dead, too, and[N]
you're here to finish the job[Beat][AN]
Just do it already.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]What?[A]
[MR][2LB]
[OpenEyes]I can explain why I sold out[N]
the Roseblades, if you'd like.[AN]
But again, would you even[N]
care what I have to say?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Do it, then. Spit out[N]
whatever bullshit you want.[AN]
Don't expect forgiveness.[N]
Don't expect mercy.[AN]
But [OpenEyes]if it makes you feel better[N]
about what's about to happen-[A]
[MR][3LB]
It was Captain Francisca.[AN]
The last job she planned, a[N]
raid on the Keepers' village[N]
down there in the Old World[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]So many lives would've been lost.[N]
Ours, and innocent civilians too.[A]
[ML][2LB]
And what?[AN]
You stuck a knife in her gut[N]
because you didn't like her plans?[A]
[MR][3LB]
[OpenEyes]I led us into TORCH's trap[N]
because I knew what was coming.[AN]
Leandra and I told Francisca[N]
about this, a dozen times,[AN]
but she didn't listen to[N]
mere swabbies like us.[AN]
She would've led us all to[N]
become worse monsters than TORCH.[AN]
[Beat]So I had to do something.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I had to find someone,[N]
anyone, who could stop[N]
her before it was too late.[A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]We would've made it, y'know.[AN]
We would've been the best damn[N]
pirates the sky's ever seen.[AN]
It could've been the Roseblades,[N]
not the Blackhearts or the Skysabers.[A]
[MR]
[CloseEyes]But they're gone. And the[N]
blame for that lies on me.[AN]
If you want a pirate's fame,[N]
Desiderio, you have it.[AN]
The quartermaster of the Skysabers,[N]
laying claim to the skies.[AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes]And all that's left[N]
for you to is cut me down.[AN]
Isn't that right?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]Hell. What's[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]what's the damn point?[AN]
[OpenEyes]I've got more to live for, now,[N]
than burying an axe in your gut.[AN]
Can't say it'd get me anywhere.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]You're not worth killing, Rogelio.[AN]
Go hide in a gutter. Betray[N]
someone else, like you always do.[AN]
It's not my problem anymore.[AN]
The Roseblades are done for,[N]
but the Skysabers are still here.[AN]
[Smile]And for Captain Lua's sake,[N]
I'll see her journey through.[AN][Smile]
[Beat][OpenEyes]And that journey doesn't involve[N]
spending another second in this wreck.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Can't say I ever expected[N]
you to let me live, Desiderio.[AN]
I'm done fighting. My[N]
men are dead, now. But[Beat][A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]Goodbye, Rogelio.[AN]
I won't miss you.[A][X]

## D1_Outro_RogelioAlive
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]That's that, then.[AN]
All that's left of the Roseblades,[N]
now[Beat] I've laid it to rest for good.[AN]
With this, Francisca, will[N]
you finally be satisfied[Beat]?[A]
[MR][LoadLua]
Razvan says the rest of[N]
the Icy Crown is clear.[AN]
The Blackhearts are[N]
making a run for it,[AN]
and the rebels lost the will[N]
to fight without their leader.[A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]Right. Let's loot what[N]
we need and head out.[AN]
We'll not spend any more time in[N]
this damn ruin than we have to.[A]
[MR]
Right.[AN]
[Beat]And as for Rogelio? The[N]
man you came here to kill?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I left him alive. There[N]
was no damn point, anyway.[AN]
[CloseEyes]The Rogelio I once fought with[N]
was brave, in his own way.[AN]
All I saw in there was a[N]
cowering shell of a man.[AN]
Taking his head wouldn't bring[N]
back everything we've lost.[AN]
No[Beat] I've done that far better[N]
[Smile]at your side[Smile], these past years.[AN]
[OpenEyes]And it's given me an answer to[N]
your question from earlier, Lua.[A]
[MR][1LB]
My question[Beat]?[A]
[ML][3LB]
[OpenQuote]What's it like to[N]
hate someone this much?"[AN]
[CloseEyes]I can't say how I'll feel[N]
in a month or a year from now.[AN]
And I'll never know how[N]
Francisca might feel about[N]
the way things turned out.[AN]
But there, in that room,[N]
standing over all that[N]
was left of Rogelio[Beat][AN]
I can't say I felt the[N]
anger I thought I did.[AN]
Pity, maybe. Despair. But[N]
there was no room left for rage.[A]
[MR][2LB]
Whatever this meant[N]
to you, Desiderio[Beat][AN]
[Smile]I'm glad we could finally[N]
put your past to rest.[A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]Thanks, Captain.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I guess I do have an answer[N]
for how Francisca would feel now.[AN]
If she would be anything like[N]
you are now, Captain Lua[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]we'd have each others' backs,[N]
no matter what's to come.[A][X]

Why we didn't kill Rogelio.[AN]
Seems like that makes this[N]

[CloseEyes]All three of us are here[N]

[OpenEyes]not that you ever need[N]
help with that, Leandra.[A]

Hey, I don't do this whole sappy[N]
reminiscing thing. Not my style.[AN]
Just feels a bit odd,[N]
coming all this way and[N]
not finishing the job.[AN]
And Desiderio changed his[N]
mind in a single conversation?[AN]
After we fought through[N]
the whole darn fort outside?[A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]We all find closure[N]
in our own ways, Leandra.[AN]
For you, that's clearly[N]
moving on to the next job.[AN]
For me[Beat] I thought Snowthorne[N]
gave me that, for a while.[AN]
And I can't speak for Desi.[N]
Not then, and not now.[A][OpenEyes]
[MR]
Where's the [OpenQuote]closure" in leaving[N]
Rogelio alive to cause trouble?[AN]
I mean, if any of y'all want[N]
me to do the job instead,[AN]
you could've just said so![A][CSS]

[FL][LoadDesiderio]
[CloseEyes]It doesn't matter anymore.[N]
Hell, maybe it never did.[AN][OpenEyes]
Besides, smashing that traitor's[N]
skull can't bring anyone back.[AN]
[Smile]I've got everyone I need,[N]
here with me in the Skysabers.[A]
[MR]
Now that part's a notion[N]
I can certainly get behind.[A]

[Beat]As always, Desi.[AN]
[CloseEyes]You saved me from Snowthorne,[N]

now, we'll see Lua's[N]

those Rebels, don't you?[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I've earned your vaunted[N]
[OpenQuote]freedom" a dozen times over.[A][N]
And using it for Alonso's[N]
sake is my choice alone.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]I'd sooner die a Blackheart[N]
than a backstabber like you![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
[Beat]You will die one.[A][X]

## D1_BQ_DalilaLua
[MR][LoadLua]
[Beat]Really?[AN]
You again?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
I was thinking the same thing.[AN]
Your lot really has a knack[N]
for finding trouble, don't you?[AN]
You've got us, TORCH, and[N]
those rebels all on your tail.[AN]
[Smile]The whole sky wants[N]
you dead, Captain Lua.[AN]
It's frankly a miracle[N]
you aren't already.[Smile][A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
We've done what we must.[AN]
[Beat]Though your Blackhearts seem[N]
too fond of picking fights, too.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
You really think you, of all[N]
people, can tell us what to do?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Despite it all, [Smile]the Skysabers[N]
are still alive and fighting.[AN][Smile]
That's more than you[N]
can say, isn't it?[AN]
How many Blackheart lives[N]
has Alonso thrown away[AN]
trying to bring me down?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Oh, [Smile]I'll be the[N]
last one he needs.[A][X]

## D1_BQ_DalilaDesiderio
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Outta my way, Blackheart![AN]
This place is my fight[N]
to pick, not yours.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Arrogant, aren't you?[AN]
We're pirates, you know.[N]
Proper ones. We do as we wish.[AN]
We take what we want,[AN]
and don't need any dreams[N]
of heroism chaining us down.[AN]
Not like your precious Captain[N]
Lua, or your former friends.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[Beat]The Roseblades' name doesn't[N]
deserve to stain your lips.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Sounds like all you're here[N]
to do is kill and steal, then.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
You think you know revenge?[N]
You think you know betrayal?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
No.[AN]
[Smile]All I need to know is[N]
where to shoot to kill you.[A][X]

## D1_BQ_DalilaRazvan
[ML][LoadDalila]
Leaving you alive was the[N]
greatest mistake of my life.[AN]
You and that motley little[N]
crew of yours, boy[Beat][AN]
How many times by now have you[N]
gotten in the Blackhearts' way?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat][CloseEyes]It doesn't matter.[N]
Not after everything.[AN][OpenEyes]
I'll keep standing,[N]
and keep fighting,[AN]
for as long as it takes.[AN]
[Beat]It's not too late[N]
to surrender, Dalila.[AN]
Captain Lua's still[N]
merciful, deep down-[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Mercy's what got us[N]
both into this mess.[AN]
Killing you is how[N]
I get out of it.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Maybe you're right, then.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Maybe there is no[N]
room for mercy anymore![A][X]

## D1_BQ_DalilaGeneric
[ML][LoadDalila]
Deceive before we[N]
can be deceived.[AN]
Take before we can[N]
be taken from.[AN]
Kill before we[N]
can be killed![A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeDesiderio
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
I never liked you, Solange.[A][N]
Not even back when the[N]
gang was all together.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[Beat]The feeling is mutual.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I don't miss the Roseblades,[N]
now that all's said and done[Beat][A][N][OpenEyes]
and I definitely don't[N]
miss you, of all people.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[OpenQuote]I don't miss the Roseblades"?[A][N]
Is that all you have[N]
to say for yourself?[A][N]
You abandoned our crew![N]
Our family! Our home![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
You're seeing the Roseblades[N]
through rose-colored glasses.[A][N]
It was never the perfect team[N]
you remember calling family.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[Beat]What are you talking about?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[CloseEyes]You were close to Captain[N]
Francisca, Desiderio.[A][N]
She brought you in on[N]
her plans, her dreams[Beat][A][N]
The rest of us were left[N]
to sit out in the cold.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]You think being a pirate[N]
is a life of heroic freedom?[A][N]
All it meant was[N]
her bossing us around![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Even as we started taking[N]
more and more risks,[A][N]
involving more and more[N]
innocents in our raids.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]We didn't have a voice.[A][N]
We couldn't speak up to ask[N]
Francisca to change her plans.[A][N]
That was why Rogelio sold[N]
out the Roseblades, Desi.[A][N]
Because [OpenEyes]if he didn't, we'd all[N]
die nameless and chained![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][OpenEyes]You admit it, then.[N]
Rogelio sold out the Roseblades.[A][N]
Maybe you've got a point.[A][N]
Maybe Francisca wasn't[N]
the best captain to you.[A][N]
But they were my crew,[N]
and they were yours, too.[A][N]
And lots of good people died[N]
because of Rogelio's tricks.[A][N]
And it's for their sake that[N]
I'm here to kill you both![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[CloseEyes]I knew you wouldn't understand.[N]
You never had it in you.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]We'll settle this the[N]
only way you know, Desi[Beat][A][N]
with one of us dead.[A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeErnest
[MR][LoadErnest]
Solange[Beat] you're still alive?[A][N]
I thought you were long dead,[N]
after all these years[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
It took me a moment to[N]
recognize you, Ernest.[A][N]
Rogelio said you'd even[N]
abandoned Desiderio, eventually.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadErnest]
We'd never leave each[N]
other behind, Solange.[A][N]
Not the way you and[N]
Rogelio abandoned us all.[A][N]
I know you have it in[N]
you to grasp that truth.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Yet I know you've not[N]
come for a touching reunion.[A][N]
You want Rogelio dead.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadErnest]
Desi wants Rogelio dead.[A][N]
I'm just here to[N]
stand by his side.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Then both of you[N]
must die for his sake.[A][N]
[Beat]Farewell, Ernest.[A][N]
Out of respect for the[N]
friendship we once held,[A][N]
I'll make this quick.[A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeKai
[ML][LoadSolange]
[Beat]Hold on a moment.[N]
I've seen you before.[AN]
Weren't you one[N]
of Azahar's men?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
Yeah. Long story, that.[N]
Was she a friend o' yours?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Not long ago, her Unchained[N]
disappeared into the night.[AN]
That was your lot's[N]
doing, wasn't it?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
Now, see, why would I[N]
be givin' away secrets?[AN]
Ain't we here to fight?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Maybe so. But I[N]
want answers, first.[AN]
Azahar[Beat] [CloseEyes]I'll admit she was[N]
never a kindhearted soul,[AN]
but she was my friend.[AN]
She believed in making[N]
this world a better place.[AN]
[OpenEyes]And now all that remains is[N]
a single traitorous lackey.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
Traitor? You're one to talk.[AN]
Ain't this whole thing 'cause[N]
you sold out your friends?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
You know nothing of loyalty![AN]
Unlike you, I've stood by[N]
Rogelio through thick and thin.[AN]
I've laid down my[N]
life for his sake![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
In that case, if you're[N]
askin' to die, then[Beat][A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeLeandra
[MR][LoadLeandra]
Oh, hey Solange. Still[N]
hanging out with Rogelio?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[Beat]You could say that.[AN]
Just how many of you[N]
are here for his head?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
Oh, I stopped counting[N]
a good while ago.[AN]
Captain Lua loves hiring[N]
every misfit she comes across.[AN]
Though hey, [Smile]that's how[N]
I got this job[Smile], so[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Rogelio was right, then.[AN]
That really is the[N]
cruel irony of it all.[AN]
We really have wilted,[N]
while even you have grown.[OpenEyes][A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
We don't have to fight, y'know.[AN]
You could just switch[N]
sides and join up with us.[AN]
After all, your other option[N]
doesn't look good right now[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
I will not abandon Rogelio.[N]
Don't try to convince me.[AN]
[CloseEyes]If you're so determined to[N]
see our last hopes broken[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
Stand and fight, Leandra![N]
You'll have to strike me down![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Right.[AN]
[OpenEyes]No hard feelings over[N]
what's about to happen, okay?[A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeGeneric
[ML][LoadSolange]
Even if our time has come[Beat][AN]
You won't reach Rogelio.[N]
Not while I still stand![A][X]

## D1_BQ_Rogelio
[ML][LoadRogelio]
[Beat]End it, then.[N]
I'm ready.[A][X]

## DalilaRematchDQ
[ML][LoadDalila]
Pushed my luck[N]
for the final time[Beat][AN]
[HalfCloseEyes]Alonso, it's up to you[Beat][AN]
[ToggleSmile]Lead the Blackhearts[Beat][N]
to [CloseEyes]glory[Beat]![A][X]

## SolangeDQ
[ML][LoadSolange]
[HalfCloseEyes]We had[Beat] [Smile]good times[Beat][N][Smile]
Rogelio[Beat] Francisca[Beat][AN]
I don't regret[Beat][N]
it for[Beat] a [CloseEyes]second[Beat][A][X]

## RogelioDQ
[ML][LoadRogelio]
[CloseEyes]Francisca? Is that you[Beat]?[AN]
I hope[Beat] hope you[N]
can forgive me, someday[Beat][AN]
I[Beat][A][X]
