## HubChaptersDesc
Hub chapters are non-battle[N]
chapters where Lua can walk[N]
(or fly) around the area.[N]
In Hubs, you can find items,[N]
recruit new allies, or take[N]
on battle chapters that are[N]
marked via red flashing tiles.[N]
[N]
These chapters can be taken[N]
in any order that you choose.[N]
Once a chapter in the set[N]
is completed, all other[N]
chapters will scale.[N]
Every enemy and player unit[N]
in them will level up by 1,[N]
increasing their stats.[N]
[N]
This cycle will repeat as[N]
more chapters are completed[N]
until all of them are done.[N]
Once this occurs, you will[N]
be able to move past[N]
the Hub to a new chapter,[N]
progressing the main story[N]
and transitioning into[N]
another Hub area to explore.[N][X]

## NewWeaponTypesDesc
There are three new weapon[N]
types: Knives, Tomes, and Guns.[N]
Tomes are a consolidation[N]
of Dark, Light, and Anima.[N]
[N]
Knives are physical weapons[N]
that are half 1-2 range[N]
weapons and half 1 range.[N]
[N]
Guns are also physical, but[N]
they use Dexterity to improve[N]
their damage, not Strength.[N]
These are primarily 2 range[N]
locked and exist outside[N]
of the Weapon Triangle.[N][X]

## WTAAndBreakDesc
The Sword -> Axe -> Lance[N]
triangle is still the same,[N]
but now, there's also a[N]
Tome -> Bow -> Knife one.[N]
Weapon Triangle is also buffed[N]
slightly, now +2 Mt/15 Hit.[N]
[N]
The main change is that[N]
attacking a unit with[N]
WTA and hitting them now[N]
inflicts Break, a status[N]
which makes the target unable[N]
to counterattack during the[N]
initial round of combat[N]
and for one more round[N]
after the enemy is Broken.[N]
[N]
A Broken unit will recover[N]
once the current turn passes.[N][X]

## PersonalSkillsDesc
Every unit has a unique skill[N]
which helps define them.[N]
[N]
Effects vary significantly:[N]
some improve the user's combat,[N]
some provide support to an ally,[N]
but all of them should provide[N]
more impact than other skills.[N][X]

## ClassSkillsDesc
Steal and Locktouch[N]
Primarily infantry skills.[N]
Locktouch allows the user to[N]
open any Chest or Door.[N]
Steal allows the user to take[N]
any unequipped item from the[N]
target's inventory, so long as:[N]
[N]
- User Speed >= Target Speed[N]
- User Con >= Item Weight[N]
[N]
Units can still Steal even[N]
if their inventory is full.[N]
[N]
Unbreakable[N]
An armored unit class skill.[N]
User cannot be Broken.[N]
[N]
Canto/Canto+/Skills[N]
Fliers all have Canto.[N]
After most actions (except[N]
Attack and Wait), the unit[N]
can use any leftover Mov.[N]
[N]
Horseback and wolf riders[N]
instead use Canto+, which[N]
allows them to use leftover[N]
Mov after all actions.[N]
[N]
Personal Skills like Canter,[N]
Sea Shanty, and Sidepierce[N]
will not overlap with any[N]
other form of Canto.[N]
[N]
Further, skills that refresh[N]
a unit's action but do not[N]
allow them to move (Disarm,[N]
Deft Hands, etc.) will not[N]
also not allow Canto skills.[N]
[N]
Flight[N]
Used by all fliers.[N]
The ability to move over[N]
terrain that others cannot,[N]
as well as Pass through[N]
enemy units at will.[N]
[N]
Aid+:[N]
Used by most mounts.[N]
Provides (25 - Con) Aid.[N]
[N]
Canto+[N]
Used by horseback mounts
and [N]
with only one weapon type.[N]
Allows the unit to use leftover[N]
Mov after any action.[N]
[N]
Move+[N]
Used by promoted cavs and[N]
fliers with one weapon type.[N]
Gives them +1 Mov compared[N]
to other units of their type.[N]
[N]
Armsmaster[N]
Used by promoted infantry[N]
with only one weapon type.[N]
Gives the user WTA against[N]
their own weapon type (unless[N]
the enemy also has Armsmaster).[N][X]

## SkillScrollsDesc
Skill scrolls can be used[N]
to teach their user skills,[N]
which are generally less[N]
powerful than personal skills.[N]
Each unit can have a maximum[N]
of two skills from scrolls.[N]
If this is exceeded, then[N]
the unit can forget one of[N]
their learned skills to make[N]
space for another (the skill[N]
must be used on map to do this.)[N]
Hubs work for this, if needed.[N][X]

## PromotionDesc
Promotions operate similarly[N]
to FE8 in that there are[N]
two options, but the promotion[N]
that a unit receives is based[N]
on the item that they use.[N]
[N]
For instance, a Mercenary[N]
using a Brave Crest will[N]
promote to Hero, but if[N]
they use a Rider's Badge,[N]
then they'll promote into[N]
a Ranger instead.[N]
[N]
Each class can only use[N]
two promotion items.[N]
Here is a list of all[N]
class promotion items:[N]
[N]
BC - Brave Crest[N]
Gives or improves user[N]
Sword, Lance, or Axe rank.[N]

Gives user a flying steed[N]

[N]
KP - Knight Plate[N]

displayed, for EXP purposes.[N][X]

in battle (for shields).[N][X]
