Fighting for the Rebels?[N]

But how can that justify[N]
living in these ruins,[AN]
stealing from innocent[N]
villagers and merchants[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]all of this?[A][CSSCF]

[CloseEyes]Those dastards from T.O.R.C.H.[N]

Look, Cruz is the one who does[N]
this planning stuff, okay?[AN]
I'm just the muscle.[A][CSSCF]

You're playing attack dog[N]
for some crew of pirates[Beat][AN]
why?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
See, that's a[N]
damn good question.[AN]
But the long and short of[N]

Helping out those in need.[AN]
Now, I don't know if[N]
you are too, but[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]

[MR][LoadOndeh]
The Rioja Reapers were[N]
far scarier than you are.[AN]
I've escaped them too.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Escaped? You mean you[N]
couldn't even take them down?[AN]
How's that fill you with[N]
confidence for fighting me?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadOndeh]

not to stop and banter.[AN]
You, though? You've given me[N]

So you were the griffin rider[N]
who broke into my home[Beat][AN]
Why do such a thing?[A][CSSCF]

You had my friend locked[N]
up. I had to free him.[AN]
That's the start and[N]
the end of it all.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
[Beat]What surprises me is that[N]
Cruz truly was[Beat] it all.[AN]
You hurt no one during[N]
your rescue mission.[AN]
[Beat]I was sleeping.[N]
Why not kill me then?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Because I'm not a bad person.[AN]
Or, at least, I try[N]
my best not to be.[AN]
Cruz says his assassinations[N]
are doing the right thing[Beat][AN]
but in my mind,[AN]
the Maker can't abide killing[N]
someone who can't fight back.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
And yet you lay your[N]
life down for Cruz.[A][CSSCF]

in Port Receloso,[AN]
your murders hardly live[N]
up to those ideals at all.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
[CloseEyes]Why, you[Beat][AN]
You're just a healer![AN]
You don't know what it means[N]
to put your life on the line![AN]
But just like in my books[Beat][N]
[OpenEyes]I'll teach you that lesson![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzPilar
[ML][LoadCruz]
Some sort of spy?[AN]
Are you really the best[N]
Lady Magdalena could send?[AN]
Pah. You're nothing but[N]
another Imperial pawn![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Do you think you know what[N]
the rebellion even is?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
What are you talking about?[AN]
I've killed for the rebellion.[N]
My friends have died for it.[AN]
We're all doing what it takes[AN]
to free these beautiful skies[N]
from Incendivis's iron grip.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Doing what it takes? You're[N]
hardly doing anything at all.[AN]
Too bad you won't live[N]
to make any real change.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
Then you'll be the one to[N]
die for your cause instead![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzOrlando
[ML][LoadCruz]
Imperial merchants like[N]
you make me sick.[AN]
Throwing around coins like[N]
they're nothing but dirt,[AN]
while ruining the livelihoods[N]
of anyone in your way.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadOrlando]
Mm. You make a good point.[AN]
I've a few business partners[N]
who fit that description.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
And let me guess.[AN]
You think you're so[N]
much better than them?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadOrlando]
Hard to say. But I know[N]
that compared to them,[AN]
I'm much better at killing.[A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzGeneric
[ML][LoadCruz]
It's all gone wrong[Beat][N]
but I can still fix this.[AN]
Just more lives to take[Beat][AN]
more lackeys of Incendivis[N]
to put in the ground![A][X]

## PilarAzaharBQ
[MR][LoadPilar]
You must be the leader here.[N]
You call yourselves Unchained?[AN]
How do your actions here further[N]
the anti-Incendivis cause?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
That's none of your business.[AN]
I'm not explainin' myself[N]
to a nosy old bat, got it?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Just another pretender, hm?[N]
You don't see the big picture[Beat][AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
The hell are you on about?[AN]
If you wanna fight,[N]
then get on with it![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Stupid, too? I shouldn't have[N]
wasted my breath with you.[AN]
Let me rectify that mistake![A][X]

## DesiAzaharBQ
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
So you're the boss of these[N]
losers? Answer me this, woman.[AN]
Do you know a man named Rogelio?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
I'm not tellin' you a damn thing,[N]
one eye. Back off, or die.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Not very smart, are you?[AN]
The boss and I don't want[N]
to kill if we don't have to,[AN]
but if you don't talk soon,[N]
I can't promise anything![A][X]

## KaiAzaharBQ
[MR][LoadKai]
Oh, heya boss. I got bad news.[AN]
These guys hired me, so[Beat][N]
I'm switchin' to this side.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
Pah. Always knew you were a rat,[N]
but you sure turned on me fast.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
It's nothin' personal, really.[N]
But hey, we're not killin' you.[AN]
If you give up now, I'll make[N]
sure they treat you well, boss.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
How about I chop off your head,[N]
instead, and walk out of here?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
[Beat]Well, time for Plan B.[N]
Don't say I didn't warn you![AN][X]

## ErnestAzaharBQ
[MR][LoadErnest]
This place is very important[N]
to me. Could you surrender?[AN]
I don't want to see any more[N]
bloodshed here, if possible.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
[Beat]Ah, you knew Rogelio, huh?[AN]
He was always talkin' about[N]
how your crew were pansies.[AN]
If you're gonna keep shakin',[N]
then you'd better turn tail.[AN]
You wouldn't want me to stain[N]
those roses red, would you?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadErnest]
I'm afraid you misunderstand.[N]
I do not fear you; I loathe you.[AN]
Even so, I wanted to avoid this,[N]
but if you insist on fighting[Beat][AN]
The only blood being shed[N]
will be yours, wretch![AN][X]

## LuaAzaharBQ
[MR][LoadLua]
So you're the one calling[N]
the shots around here.[AN]
Well, you see what we did[N]
to the rest of your gang.[AN]
Back down, or you're next.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAzahar]
Oh, you think you're tough?[AN]
Sorry, but I'm not as weak[N]
as the rest of the Unchained.[AN]
Buncha losers[Beat] You're[N]
doing me a favor, really.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
[Beat]That's how you talk[N]
about the people you lead?[AN]
Forget the peace offer, then.[AN]
Let me give you a taste[N]
of how your crew felt![AN][X]

## AzaharBQ
[ML][LoadAzahar]
Tch[Beat] Made it this far, huh?[AN]
If you hadn't chased us,[N]
I'd have let you run free.[AN]
But we need this fuel[Beat][N]
I'm not lettin' you take it![A][X]

Hell, the two of you are[N]
abandoning ship now, eh?[AN]
Should've known you've always[N]
cared more about your own hides.[AN][CSSCF]

[MR][LoadAdrian][2LB]
Hey, we were both pretty genuine[N]
on it after Sarif's gang got wiped.[AN][Clear]
But truth be told[Beat][ToggleSmile][N]
you're kinda an ass.[N]
I'll take any sorta pirate[N]
compared to the likes of you.[AN][CSSCF]

your blood all over the ground![A][X]

Hell, the two of you are[N]

Should've known you've always[N]

[MR][LoadLexa]
Sorry man, but you're the one[N]
who thought this was a good idea.[AN]
Did'ya really think 'conquering' a[N]
village was going to just slide?[AN]
Now we've got pirates and imperials[N]
on our asses[Beat]no thank you![AN]
I'm sure if you were in my spot,[N]
you'd dip out with the pirates too![AN][CSSCF]

[ML][LoadJavier]
At least I'd show some loyalty[N]
to the damn gang that I was in![AN]
Should've booted you and your[N]
brother out of here way before[Beat][AN][CSSCF]

[MR][LoadLexa]
Well, I'm glad you've got[N]
your regrets in mind[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
Now then, how about I make sure[N]
you won't worry about 'em again![A][X]

[ML][LoadJavier][2LB]
Wait a minute[Beat]you're[N]
one of the dolts living here![AN]
And all dressed up in uniform[Beat][AN]
I can't believe we missed--[AN][CSSCF]

[MR][LoadNoah]
*Huff, huff[Beat]*[AN]
A-Ah, give me a second! I'm[N]
still getting used to the armor.[AN][CSSCF]

[ML][LoadJavier]
Tch[Beat]you look like you[N]
could fall over any moment![AN]
Were you too tired to try[N]
and raise a sword before?[.5][AN][CSSCF]

[MR][LoadNoah]
H-[.4]Heh[Beat] You think I'm[N]
going to give into taunts?[AN]
You're the one who's made[N]
this town a terrible place[Beat][AN]
The one that's killed the[N]
rest of my friends![AN]
I-[.4]I'll avenge them, and make[N]
you regret ever coming here![AN][CSSCF]

[ML][LoadJavier]
So, maybe you do have a[N]
little spunk in you, huh?[AN]
See how good it does when you[N]
join the rest of your guard![A][X]

## B4_BossQuote_Magdalena
[ML][LoadJavier][2LB]
Well, you're pretty well-[N]
dressed for a pirate.[AN]
In fact[Beat]you supposed to[N]
be some kind of other mayor?[AN][CSSCF]

[MR][LoadMagdalena]
No[Beat]I am no mayor, not any longer.[AN]
[CloseEyes]
I failed to protect my town and home[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]
But[Beat]though I was not able to use[N]
my authority to bring justice[Beat][AN]
From this town's state[Beat]there would[N]
be no use for authority anyways[Beat][AN]
Thus[Beat]I see action as the[N]
proper way to bring about justice.[AN]
I will stamp out the tyranny your[N]
band ennacted upon the populace[Beat][AN][CSSCF]

[ML][LoadJavier][2LB]
[Beat]Lady, you're speaking[N]
far, far too much.[AN]
Whatever fancy magic you want[N]
to bear down, bring it on![A][X]

## JavierBQ

Well, you'll find me a cut above[N]
those chumps.[.4] Prepare to die.[A][X]

##B5_BQ_NicodemusFata
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
Wait, that magic[Beat][A][N]
You're the wench who's[N]
weaving all these illusions![A][N]
Now my airship's a smoking[N]
ruin, thanks to you![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadFata]
Get off my island.[AN]
Now.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
[OpenQuote]Your" island? I'm afraid[N]
this is Incendivis territory.[A][N]
And after what you[N]
did to my ship,[A][N]
it's time for you to face the[N]
sharp end of Imperial justice![A][X]

##B5_BQ_NicodemusLua
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
So the captain comes[N]
to face me herself![A][N]
You'll die either way, but[N]
if you turn yourself in,[A][N]
at least it'll go quickly.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Me and my crew have taken[N]
down far worse than you.[A][N]
Last chance to surrender[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
Me? Surrender? To some[N]
unwashed pirate like you?[A][N]
What would happen to my[N]
reputation if I did that?[A][N]
No, pirate. Today is the[N]
day I become a hero.[A][N]
And my legend will be[N]
forged in your death![A][X]

##B5_BQ_NicodemusPilar
[MR][LoadPilar]
Looks like your crew had a[N]
rougher landing than ours.[A][N]
Never met an Imperial who[N]
could pilot worth a damn.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
[CloseEyes]Why, you[Beat][N]
[OpenEyes]You think that landing matters?[A][N]
We'll take your ship, pirate.[A][N]
We'll fly it home waving[N]
the flags of the Empire.[A][N]
And they'll know that I was[N]
the one to beat you at last.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Me! Nicodemus![A][N]
Incendivis's next great hero![A][ToggleSmile][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
You're not so different from[N]
your fellow soldiers, you know.[A][N]
Smug and boastful[Beat] until[N]
my knife finds its mark.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
Try, then! No prison shank[N]

they'll do just fine![A][X]

##B5_BQ_NicodemusRazvan
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Sir[Beat][N]
please, lay down your arms![A][N]
Your men are already[N]
dead. This battle is lost.[A][N]
There's no need for a good[N]
soldier like you to die![A][N][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
You think it matters, brat?[A][N]
My soldiers' lives were[N]
one thing. I am another.[A][N]
And no mewling child[N]

## B5_BQ_NicodemusAvocado
[MR][LoadAvocado]
I know where your path leads.[A][N]
Even if you slay us all,[N]
it will not be enough[Beat][A][N]
you will never be sated.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]You will keep killing, keep[N]
turning yourself into a monster,[A][N]
until naught remains but ash.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A][N]
[Beat][OpenEyes]You think you can[N]
lecture me on my failings?[A][N]
You, in the armor of a deserter?[A][N]
You have failed Incendivis[N]
in every way that matters.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
No[Beat] I did not fail the Empire.[A][N]
I failed myself, for not[N]
leaving many years sooner.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
S-stop babbling, you senile[N]

I'll make sure you get[N]

Wait, that's[Beat][N]
YOU![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMrYodsen]
Uh[Beat][N]
w-who are you, exactly?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
I lost my life savings[N]
in your damn turnip scam![A][N]
My career - my fame - set[N]
back years, because of you![A][N]
I could've been Commander of[N]
TORCH instead of Elodia[Beat][A][N]
but that's all wiped away, and[N]
it's all thanks to you, dastard![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMrYodsen]
Well, er, why don't we[N]
just let bygones be byg-[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
I don't even know how you[N]
threw in with pirates[Beat][A][N]
but it doesn't matter![A][N]
You'll die with the rest[N]

Take your stolen coin[N]

Heh heh heh[Beat] Lookie here![AN]
You've got nowhere to run,[N]

Fall into an eternal sleep![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoAttackedBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Heh, I guess my plans weren't[N]
enough to keep y'all away.[AN]
Fine, take your shot at me.[N]
I'll pay it back tenfold![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaAttackerBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
You should've stayed far away[N]

My preparations are perfect[Beat][N]
Feel the sting of my arrows[A][X]

Damn, you all got this close?[N]
Ah, this is gonna hurt[Beat][AN]
If I make it through this,[N]
you are dead! Hear me? Dead![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoLuaBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Looks like you aren't[N]
all talk after all, Lua.[AN]
If you've got anythin' to say,[N]
get it out before we fight.[AN]
I'm a courteous man,[N]
so I won't interrupt.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Ha! I've got nothing to say[N]
to a man like you, Alonso.[AN]
Except[Beat] That if I had the[N]
chance to do it all again,[AN]
I'd have sent you Khazhak[N]
once we reached Port Greagor.[AN]
He was a bastard, sure, but[N]
he still deserved a burial.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]Well, it ain't like it'd[N]
have mattered. Either way,[AN]
we'd both be standin' here[N]
ready to kill each other.[AN]
This is how it was meant[N]
to be[Beat][A] So let's end this,[N]
here and now! Come at me![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Don't have to tell me twice![AN]
The Blackhearts die today,[N]
Alonso! And you with them![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoDesiderioBQ
[MidRight][LoadDesiderio]
Looks like you're still[N]
kickin', Alonso. Gotta say,[AN]
I thought a rat like you[N]
woulda died in some alley.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
And you are[Beat]?[N]
Ah, I remember you now![AN]
You were a member of that[N]
fool's crew. Desiderio![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDesiderio]
That's my name. Honestly,[N]
even though you're scum,[AN]
I always respected your grit.[N]
But to think, you're a captain[Beat][AN]
Do any of 'em know just how[N]
much of a fraud you are?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]A fraud? Don't know what[N]
ya mean. I'm Alonso, the Ebon-[AN]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
You're not. See, our old boss[N]
did some diggin' when you left.[AN]
This Ebon Nerve[Beat] Couldn't[N]
find a soul who knew you.[AN]
No old crews to back up your[N]
claims, no grand heists.[AN]
So tell me somethin', before[N]
I leave you bleedin' out[Beat][AN]
Who the hell are you, Alonso?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML]
[Beat]Heh. Ha ha ha ha![AN]
A good question, Desiderio.[N]
But it's like I always said:[AN]
Deceive before you can be[N]
deceived. Remember that?[AN]
When ya deceive well enough,[N]
ya make lies into truth.[AN]
All that it takes to keep[N]
up the act[Beat] is killin' you![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoOrlandoBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
An old man, really?[AN]
Lua must be runnin' out[N]
of bodies if you're here.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadOrlando]
Ah, what an original insult![AN]
I must say, you're the[N]
embodiment of wit, friend.[AN]
Perhaps you'd like to share[N]
your jokes with my crew?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Oh, I get it! You're stallin'[N]
for time. Not bad, geezer,[AN]
but I'm not fallin' for that.[AN]
Lemme give you an early[N]
retirement, right now![AN][CSSCF]

Oh? You're in Lua's crew?[AN]
Honestly, you don't look[N]
much like a pirate, lass.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCarmen]
Correct, I am no mere pirate.[N]
I am a musician! A virtuoso![AN]
And unlike you, Captain Lua[N]
appreciates my many talents.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]Really? She's an odd duck,[N]
but that's stranger still.[AN]
Well, with the way you're[N]
dressed, you must be rich.[AN]
How about I take you hostage[N]
and see if anyone cares?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCarmen]
Hmph! Even if I could return,[N]
I found a place to belong.[AN]
Captain Lua believed in me[Beat][AN]
Now, I will repay that faith.[N]
Listen, boar, to your requiem![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoXimoBQ
[MidRight][LoadXimo]
You must be the boss of the[N]

[ML][LoadAlonso]
'Course I am. And you[Beat][AN]
Well, you just look like[N]
an ordinary bloke, huh?[AN]
I could find ten losers like[N]
you in any ol' port town.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadXimo]
Heh, you're right.[N]
Or you used to be, anyway.[AN]
But Captain Lua taught me how[N]
to be someone more than that.[AN]
People trust me now to do big[N]
things, to get the job done[Beat][AN]
I'm not gonna let them down.[N]
You're just target practice![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoErnestBQ
[MidRight][LoadErnest]
Alonso[Beat] So, you're the same[N]
guy from the Roseblades, hm?[AN]
Now I see why the captain[N]
kicked you from the crew.[AN]
She must have seen how[N]
rotten you really were.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
No, she was afraid that[N]
I'd take her place![AN]
Look at all the people[N]
that I've gathered here.[AN]
Every last one of them?[N]
A lowlife, without question.[AN]
I've taken them under my[N]
wing and changed their lives.[AN]
Now, they have a place;[N]
now, they have a purpose![AN]
That's the mark of a leader,[N]
uh[Beat] Whoever you are.[AN]
And your captain feared that.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
Ernest. Regardless, you're[N]
delusional as always.[AN]
These Blackhearts follow you[N]
without question, right?[AN]
And if they do otherwise,[N]
then they lose their place,[AN]
forced to return to their[N]
meaningless everyday lives.[AN]
That means you're no leader;[N]
you're a tyrant, Alonso![AN]
And unlike my captain,[N]
I will not abide it.[AN]
I'll end this charade,[N]
right here and right now![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaPilarBQ

What do you want, old-timer?[N]
Get moving, or I'll shoot.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadPilar]
Do you have eyes, girl?[N]
I have a knife in my hand.[AN]
Take this seriously,[N]
or you'll find it in your gut.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Heh[Beat] Am I supposed[N]
to be scared of you?[AN]
I grew up in a shithole town[N]
with nothing to live for.[AN]
Every day, all I could do[N]
was survive til the next one,[AN]
but then Alonso came along.[AN]
He pulled me out of that[N]
place and gave me a new life.[AN]
Here, I'm needed, wanted.[N]
Even if I die here to you,[AN]
I'll have served my purpose[N]
to him and the whole crew.[AN]
That's all that matters![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadPilar]
[Beat]Is that so? I pity you.[AN]
You're no more than a puppet[N]

You could be so much more[Beat][AN]
But if that's how you wish[N]
to live your life, so be it![AN][X]

## Ch3DalilaRazvanBQ
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
You[Beat] I remember you![AN]
You led a group of Blackhearts[N]
in raiding a marine ship.[AN]
I couldn't fight back,[N]
so you spared my life,[AN]
but you killed everyone else[N]
and left me alone, stranded.[AN]
Does that ring any bells?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
[Beat]Too many to count.[AN]
I have no idea who you are[N]
or when this happened,[AN]
but if you want an apology,[N]
then you'll be disappointed.[AN]
Honestly, you should thank me.[AN]
If it was Alonso leading it,[N]
you wouldn't be standing here.[AN]
[OQ]No loose ends[CQ], he says[Beat][N]
I should have listened.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
Yes, you should have listened.[N]
Not to him, your conscience![AN]
Whatever shred of it you had[N]
that made you spare me[Beat][AN]
Let me thank it and apologize.[AN]
Because now, I'm no longer[N]
defenseless.[A] I'm no longer[N]
alone, crying out for justice![AN]
And I will no longer tolerate[N]
devils like you in this world![A][X]

Wow, that's a neat ballista![N]
Did you make it yourself?[AN]
I've always wanted one that[N]
I could use on horseback,[AN]

That one seems pretty light,[N]
though. It's impressive work![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Uh, thanks, but why are you[N]
praising me right now, kid?[AN]
You know we're enemies, right?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRahel]
Huh? Oh, I couldn't help[N]
myself when I saw it.[AN]
You know how it is, right?[AN]
When an inventor sees a cool[N]
gadget, everything else can wait.[AN]
Still, it's a real shame that[N]
we have to fight each other[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
But if it's either you or me,[N]
then I'm always picking me.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
[Beat]Heh. Isn't that the truth?[AN]
That's what it means to be[N]
a pirate[Beat] To be who you are,[AN]
no matter what anyone thinks.[AN]
Whether I'm viewed as a liar,[N]
a thief, or a cruel killer[Beat][AN]
So long as I can live my way,[N]
then I couldn't care less![AN][CSSCF]

Hm[Beat] If Master Ida never took[N]
me in, maybe I'd feel the same.[AN]
But she taught me that doing[N]
good's always worth it,[AN]
and to pay it forward when[N]
people help you out, too.[AN]
And Captain Lua taught me[N]
something important, too:[AN]
no matter what side of the law[N]
you're on, it doesn't matter.[AN][ToggleSmile]
A woman's gotta have a code![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Such a naive response[Beat][AN]
Well, tell me, girl.[N]
What's this code?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRahel]
It's a simple one, really.[AN]
To back up my captain and[N]
crewmates, no matter what![AN]
[Beat]Just don't tell Orlando[N]
or the captain that, though.[AN]
I'd die of embarrassment![AN][CSSCF]

Bah, I'm not running![AN]
The dog you sent after Lua[N]

Nicodemus was his name.[AN]
He brought a battle to[N]

He disturbed my peace![AN][CSSCF]

he was completely useless[Beat][AN]
Look, I'll let you walk away.[AN]

Don't be surprised when[N]
you get burned![A][X]

Can't say I have.[AN]
Not that I'm in the habit of[N]

Not often they get away[N]

What's your trick?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadTangyuan]
Remember that security[N]
team you were with?[AN]
They wouldn't even let[N]

I've still got a grudge[N]
going, from back then.[AN]
And I figure I'll take[N]
the last of it out on you![A][CSSCF]

That's your sob story? You[N]

I'm not your bookworm[N]

I've seen you before.[AN]
Weren't you one[N]
of Azahar's men?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
Yeah. Long story, that.[N]
Was she a friend o' yours?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Not long ago, her Unchained[N]
disappeared into the night.[AN]
That was your lot's[N]
doing, wasn't it?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
Now, see, why would I[N]
be givin' away secrets?[AN]
Ain't we here to fight?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
Maybe so. But I[N]
want answers, first.[AN]
Azahar[Beat] [CloseEyes]I'll admit she was[N]
never a kindhearted soul,[AN]
but she was my friend.[AN]
She believed in making[N]
this world a better place.[AN]
[OpenEyes]And now all that remains is[N]
a single traitorous lackey.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
Traitor? You're one to talk.[AN]
Ain't this whole thing 'cause[N]
you sold out your friends?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
You know nothing of loyalty![AN]
Unlike you, I've stood by[N]
Rogelio through thick and thin.[AN]
I've laid down my[N]
life for his sake![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadKai]
In that case, if you're[N]
askin' to die, then[Beat][A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeLeandra
[MR][LoadLeandra]
Oh, hey Solange. Still[N]
hanging out with Rogelio?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[Beat]You could say that.[AN]
Just how many of you[N]
are here for his head?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
Oh, I stopped counting[N]
a good while ago.[AN]
Captain Lua loves hiring[N]
every misfit she comes across.[AN]
Though hey, [Smile]that's how[N]
I got this job[Smile], so[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Rogelio was right, then.[AN]
That really is the[N]
cruel irony of it all.[AN]
We really have wilted,[N]
while even you have grown.[OpenEyes][A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
We don't have to fight, y'know.[AN]
You could just switch[N]
sides and join up with us.[AN]
After all, your other option[N]
doesn't look good right now[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSolange]
I will not abandon Rogelio.[N]
Don't try to convince me.[AN]
[CloseEyes]If you're so determined to[N]
see our last hopes broken[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
Stand and fight, Leandra![N]
You'll have to strike me down![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeandra]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Right.[AN]
[OpenEyes]No hard feelings over[N]
what's about to happen, okay?[A][X]

## D1_BQ_SolangeGeneric
[ML][LoadSolange]
Even if our time has come[Beat][AN]
You won't reach Rogelio.[N]
Not while I still stand![A][X]

## D1_BQ_Rogelio
[ML][LoadRogelio]
[Beat]End it, then.[N]
I'm ready.[A][X]

## D3_Enrique_Razvan_BQ
[MR][LoadRazvan]
You[Beat] Get out of my way![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Easy, boy. No need to rush.[AN]
We have plenty of time[Beat][N]
Oh, I suppose that's just me?[AN]
Your mother could die any[N]
moment now, after all.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]Was all of this an act[N]
to make me lose my cool?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]What makes you think that?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
I just can't imagine that[N]
T.O.R.C.H. would allow you,[AN]
an officer of high rank,[N]
to ever reach your station.[AN]
That is, if you're truly as[N]
morally bankrupt as you seem.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Heh. Quite a strange view of[N]
Incenvidis's leaders, boy.[AN]
So long as I complete my duty[N]
to hunt pirates like you,[AN]
why would they care about[N]
the lives of mere outcasts?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]Is that so? Then perhaps[N]
I was mistaken, after all.[AN]
Not that it matters, really.[AN]
No matter your intent,[AN]
you've endangered the lives[N]
of my mother and many more.[AN]
And that is a sin that[N]
I refuse to forgive![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Heh[Beat] I need no forgiveness.[AN]
If it is for the sake of[N]
gaining the Fire Emblem,[AN]
then no sin is too grave![AN][X]

## D3_Enrique_Calista_BQ
[MR][LoadCalista]
So you're the big, bad[N]
T.O.R.C.H. boss here?[AN]
Sounds like you're a[N]
real piece of work.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Silence, you. I won't[N]
hear any critique,[AN]
not from a mere pirate![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadCalista]
Ah, but I'm more than that.[AN]
I used to march to the[N]
same song, after all.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
A former imperial, then[Beat][N]
And you fell to piracy?[AN]
I must say, I care even[N]
less about your opinion.[AN]
Someone like you, who'd[N]
betray your sacred oaths[Beat][AN]
Your opinion means nothing![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadCalista]
Ha! Yeah, that's all that[N]
I've heard my whole career.[AN]
Whenever I had something[N]
that troubled my conscience,[AN]
I could count on some hardass[N]
like you giving that spiel.[AN]
[OQ]Keeping the order,[N]
and keeping the oath.[CQ][AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Those two tenets are[N]
central for a reason![AN]
Without order, a society[N]
has no means to survive,[AN]
and without holding fast[N]
to some kind of oath,[AN]
how can anyone trust those[N]
tasked to defend the order?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadCalista]
Yeah, yeah, I've heard[N]
your whole speech before.[AN]
But you just don't get it[Beat][AN]
Holding to a code no matter[N]
what is no more than idiocy.[AN]
If I'd done that myself,[AN]
then I'd have had to attack[N]
this crew after they saved me.[AN]
Where's the justice in that?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
It matters not. Subjective[N]
ideas of justice, like yours[Beat][AN]
They're no more than solipsism![AN]
Societal ideas of justice are[N]
shared, and thus, they are-[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadCalista]
Sorry, but I don't march[N]
to that drum anymore,[AN]
so can you stop trying[N]
to propagandize, already?[AN]
I saw the ugly outcome of[N]
your [OQ]universal justice.[CQ][AN]
That fantasy that Incendivis[N]
tries to push on everyone[Beat][AN]
It's just that, a mirage![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Do you mean to say that[N]
my life's work is nothing?[AN]
That pursuing true justice[N]
has brought about nothing?![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadCalista]
[Beat]Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But if you want justice so bad,[N]
I know where you can find it.[AN]
Look over here[Beat] It's right[N]
down the barrel of my musket![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_Avocado_BQ
[ML][LoadEnrique]
You[Beat] You're a soldier[N]
of T.O.R.C.H.! But why?[AN]
Why are you on that side?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat]I tired of the endless[N]
killing. The endless death.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
So you joined a pirate crew?[AN]
You forsook all of your oaths[N]
and turned into a traitor?![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat]No. For a time, I merely[N]
hid away in the outskirts.[AN]
But eventually, trouble came[N]
to me. I could no longer run.[AN]
And the Skysabers[Beat] They gave[N]
me purpose that I'd long lost.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
What kind of purpose could[N]
a pirate possibly have?[AN]
You're no more than thieves![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat]I joined in order to die.[N]
That was my plan, to start.[AN]
But then, over time[Beat][N]
My will to die faded.[AN]
The nightmares lessened,[N]
and I began to feel[Beat] fear.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Fear? Fear of what?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
Fear of death, that which[N]
I had chased for so long.[AN]
And now, I fear that it may[N]
reach the others in my crew.[AN]
[Beat]Perhaps all I needed[N]
was a place to belong.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Enough of this fantasy![AN]
You're a member of T.O.R.C.H.,[N]
hated by pirates of all kinds.[AN]
Do you think that your precious[N]
crew forgot that fact?[AN]
One day, you'll wake up[N]
with a knife in your chest![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
No[Beat] I am T.O.R.C.H. no longer.[N]
And were that to be my fate,[AN]
so be it. Better that than[N]
the life I led before it![AN]
Here, I gained a second chance[Beat][N]
And I refuse to waste it![AN][X]

## D3_Enrique_Pilar_BQ
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]Hm. An old woman?[AN]
What brings you to[N]
this battlefield?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
What else?[N]
I'm a pirate.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]Then I suppose I have[N]
no choice here, do I?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
You always have a choice.[N]
But for a man like you,[AN]
blinded by his position,[N]
you can't even see it.[AN]
That's how all enforcers[N]
of the empire truly are.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]Ah, hold a moment![N]
You[Beat] I remember you![AN]
It's been fifty years,[N]
and yet[Beat] I remember![AN]
You're the mad woman who[N]
assaulted an imperial base,[AN]
deep in the empire's heart[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Ah, my final gift before[N]
I sailed to the Old World?[AN]
I'd almost forgotten.[AN][CSSCF][ToggleSmile]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Gift? You call that a gift?![AN]
You killed a hundred men in[N]
the span of ten minutes![AN]
I[Beat] I was the only survivor[N]
of the Grey Ghost. Of you![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
That's the name you all chose?[N]
Well, it doesn't really matter.[AN]
Yes, I was much wilder in my[N]
youth. So much to prove[Beat][AN]
When I heard about a summit[N]
for rising Incendivis leaders,[AN]
I saw an opportunity to cripple[N]
Incendivis. For a time, at least.[AN]
[Beat]But in the end, it changed[N]
little. Such is life, I suppose.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
That's all you have to say?[AN]
You[Beat] You demon![N]
I'll avenge them all![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
[Beat]Try all you like,[N]
dog of the empire.[AN]
But, today, I swear[Beat][N]
I'll finish the job![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_Jaime_BQ
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Hm? Agh, how irritating[Beat][AN]
You mean to sit in the sky[N]
instead of fight with honor?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
Honor isn't worth a damn,[N]
so yeah, I'll stay up here.[AN]
So, gramps[Beat] You're the[N]
boss of T.O.R.C.H., here?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
That I am. Second only[N]
to Elodia. Have you met?[AN]
Hold on[Beat] You're the scion[N]
of del Rias, aren't you?[AN]
The runaway rebel noble?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
[Beat]The one and only.[AN]
I saw just how shitty[N]
Incendivis is, firsthand[Beat][AN]
I saw how easy a life I had,[AN]
because my dad could grease[N]
the right palms with gold.[AN]
Made me sick to my stomach[Beat][AN]
And so, I left home with[N]
a pegasus, and that's it.[AN]
But damn, I almost doubted[N]
myself when Elodia showed up.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
She has that way about her[Beat][AN]
Regardless, you must return[N]
home at once, Hector del Rias.[AN]
I am willing to overlook your[N]
transgressions, of course.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
[Beat]See, that's why I left.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
You don't understand, child.[AN]
It is necessary for those[N]
born into power to keep it,[AN]
for the stability of the[N]
empire. That is their charge-[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
Ridiculous! Being born into[N]
power doesn't mean a thing.[AN]
It says nothing about who[N]
I am and if I'm worthy of it.[AN]
The people who have power[N]
should be those who earn it![AN]
Isn't that how you made it[N]
to where you are now?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Of course, but comparing me[N]
to a noble family is just-[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
It's the way it should be![AN]
Here with the Skysabers,[N]
my name means nothing[Beat][AN]
And I couldn't be happier![AN]
Everything that I've got now,[N]
I earned with my own hands.[AN]
This is the life for me![AN]
So, if the captain wants[N]
you gone[Beat] You're gone![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_Desiderio_BQ
[MR][LoadDesiderio][ToggleSmile]
So, you're the head honcho?[N]
Heh, you don't look so tough![AN]
If you're the boss here,[N]
then there's no way I'd lose![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Oh? What gives a bilge-rat[N]
the right to denigrate me?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Way I see it, one of us is[N]
puttin' good people at risk.[AN]
And that ain't me, is it?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
No, it is you. You and your[N]
crew greedily grasp at power,[AN]
holding onto the Fire Emblem[N]
despite the risks entailed.[AN]
That forced my hand[Beat][N]
Leading us to this moment.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Well, ain't that convenient?[N]
Pass off all the blame to us,[AN]
when you're the one turnin'[N]
his back to the Redwings.[AN]
But let's play your game.[AN]
You say that us havin' this[N]
Fire Emblem is dangerous?[AN]
Maybe. But it'd be a hell[N]
of a lot worse if you did.[AN]
You want it bad enough to[N]
sit on your damn thumbs,[AN]
watchin' innocents die![AN]
You ask me? You're the[N]
greedy bastard, here![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Greedy[Beat] Me?[N]
Ha[Beat] Hahahaha![AN]
A pirate saying that[Beat][N]
Hahahaha! Ahahahaha![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[Beat]Laugh it up, buddy.[N]
I know who I am. What I am.[AN]
That's why I've got a clear[N]
eye and a clear heart.[AN]
And what my heart's tellin'[N]
me[Beat] is to kick your ass![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_BQ
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]You've taken quite some[N]
time to reach me, Skysabers.[AN]
I was beginning to wonder[N]
if you planned to retreat[Beat][AN]
But it seems you're made of[N]
stronger stuff than that.[AN]
You'd have to be, to make[N]
it as far as you have, hm?[AN]
[Beat]No matter. My duty is clear:[AN]
take you all into custody,[N]
and retrieve the Fire Emblem![AN]
For that, I will sacrifice[N]
anyone, even myself![A][X]

Ha[Beat] Something tells me that[N]
you're not my lucky lady.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadInka]
Looks like you've got some[N]
sense in that skull of yours.[AN]
Yeah, I'm here to kill you,[AN]
just like all your dogs have[N]
been slaughtering my boys.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadFidel]
You say it like we're the[N]
same, but you know, lady[Beat][AN]
There's one real big[N]
difference between us.[AN]
My troops did all they could[N]
to save people, not kill them.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadInka]
Look, I'm not interested[N]
in the moralizing, pal.[AN]
All I care about is that you[N]
rats are a pain in the ass,[AN]
one I'm about to get rid of![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadFidel]
[Beat]Oh, shit. This might be it.[AN]
Maker, if you're listening[Beat][N]
Give me a hand here, alright?![A][X]

[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]You're the leader, aren't[N]
you? Inka of the Redwings?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Oh? You know my name?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Of course I do! Every person[N]
who lives here knows it.[AN]
It's the name of the woman[N]
who torments us without end![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Oh, that right? Hearing that[N]
brings a warmth to my heart[Beat][AN]
It's great to know that our[N]
hate for you all is mutual![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Mutual? What did any of us[N]
ever do to you to earn that?[AN]
You're the ones who've raided[N]
homes in the dead of night[Beat][AN]
You're the ones who snatch[N]
children playing by the walls,[AN]
demanding an exorbitant[N]
ransom to return them![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Heh[Beat] And so what if we did?[AN]
Me and the guys, we didn't[N]
come out of nowhere, kid.[AN]
Some of us were orphans[N]
abandoned in the sands[Beat][AN]
Some of us were outlaws[N]
who could go nowhere else[Beat][AN]
But no matter our stories,[N]
we were cast out by society.[AN]
That's why it's [OQ]mutual[CQ].[AN]
People like you are the ones[N]
who put us in this position.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]Is that how you justify[N]
each sin that you commit?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Heh[Beat] Couldn't care less[N]
about my sins, you brat.[AN]
Me and my gang were dealt[N]
a bad hand, so we played it.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]It's true that you can't[N]
control the hand you're dealt.[AN]
Mine had its own issues, but[N]
it sounds better than yours.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
That's right! You were a lucky[N]
little shit, so shut up and-[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
But during my journeys, I've[N]
met many as bad off as you.[AN]
Some of them have fallen[N]
to banditry, that's true[Beat][AN]
But just as many have fought[N]
to better their lives![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Bah! And where did that get-[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Further than you'll ever go![AN]
Someone like you, who never[N]
tried to live an honest life[Beat][AN]
Someone who stepped on anyone[N]
and everyone in their way,[AN]
driven by nothing but spite[Beat][AN]
You could never be anything[N]
more than what you are:[AN]
a sad, pathetic wretch![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Q-Quiet, you damn brat![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan][ToggleSmile]
If my words unsettle you so,[N]

As a child, I feared you,[N]
but now, I can only pity you.[AN]

What, are you seadogs trying[N]

Nope. I've got no complaints[N]

Then why risk that life[N]
getting in our way?[AN]
What's in it for you?![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
[Beat]A member of my crew grew[N]

Oh, you want to just get[N]

If you don't care about[N]

Ha, nah. Not happening.[AN]
See, I may not really care[N]

Steady pay, easy work,[N]

You[Beat] I've seen you before,[N]
haven't I? Who are you?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
[Beat]A mere wanderer,[N]

No, no, I definitely[N]

Ah, that's right![AN]
I saw you with Kiril once,[N]
while I was scouting around.[AN][CSSCF]

You[Beat] know my cousin?[AN][CSSCF]

Know him? I was his savior![AN]
Him and his boys would've[N]
died if it wasn't for me.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
What do you mean by that?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
There was one small problem[N]
with your cousin's escape[Beat][AN]
Living out in the sands means[N]
you've got no food or drink.[AN]
And hanging out where he was,[N]
there wasn't enough to steal.[AN]
So[Beat] I provided him a service.[AN]
My Redwings carried goods[N]
to the Antlions' little hideout.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
[Beat]For a steep price, I imagine.[AN]
Is that why my cousin grew so[N]
desperate? Because of you?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Heh[Beat] Him and plenty other[N]
third-rate thieves, yeah.[AN]
Get 'em reliant on you,[N]
charge 'em with interest,[AN]
and they'll never be free.[N]
Ha[Beat] I almost pity him.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
[Beat]My cousin was no saint.[AN]
